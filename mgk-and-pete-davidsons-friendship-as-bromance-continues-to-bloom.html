The rapper, who is engaged to Megan Fox, spoke out about the feud as well as Pete’s relationship with Kim Kardashian.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MGK-and-Pete-1.jpg><h2>Friendship And Budding Bromance Of MGK and Pete Davidson</h2><p>MGK and Pete’s friendship began long before the two met Megan and Kim. They met for the first time on the set of Wild ‘N Out in 2017 and hit it off right away.</p><p>“We met at Wild ‘N Out a long time ago,” MGK previously told Billboard. “And then we met years later when I was filming that Mötley Crüe movie because he’s in that Mötley Crüe movie,” he says.</p><p>The musician even admitted to watching Pete’s segments on Saturday Night Live every week in March 2019. As he revealed more details about how the two became so close, he concluded, “So that’s my boy.” Since then, the bromance has grown stronger, and they have publicly gushed about their friendship.</p><p>He recently told Howard Stern about how his relationship with her had affected him. “I was blessed,” MGK said. We both arrived in each other’s lives at just the right time.”</p><h2>Pete Was “Totally” Supported By MGK</h2><p>According to Buzzfeed, Pete received support from MGK after Ye began slamming him on Instagram and his now-girlfriend Kim Kardashian.</p><p>Following Ye’s temporary suspension from the platform last month, MGK broke his silence on the feud. He told Howard Stern, a radio host, that he was “completely” there for the Saturday Night Live comedian.</p><p>“Intriguingly, I was thrown into that as well. At the end of the day, man, we’re young men trying to find our place in the world and figure it out, and having a million voices ripping you apart doesn’t really help,” he said.</p><p>“Everyone is loved by us, man. We have a lot of love. It’s almost as if we’re willing to be the vessels for someone else’s rage. That’s probably why we’re here. I hope they can sense our spirit and see how much we care for you.”</p><h2>Pete Will Attend MGK’s Wedding</h2><p>During his appearance on The Howard Stern Show, MGK also confirmed that Pete Davidson would be his best man. Since Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox announced their engagement, the world has been waiting to find out when the two will tie the knot.</p><p>However, the “Emo Girl” singer stated that no date had been confirmed. Stern then inquired, “Will Pete Davidson be your best man?” “I think he will.”</p><p>“I think my side is going to be an army,” MGK replied. I have so many close and best friends who have stood by my side all these years, but I believe Pete will be there as well.”</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>MGK and Pete Davidson's</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikoKNdlrulec%2Beq55llJbDqrDSqKWsZZantqa6w6yfoqhdlsBurtGopJqmk5p6pLvNraCnrZWoerW7jJujqKedZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rhonjs-teresa-giudices-biggest-fights-with-joe-melissa-gorga.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="RHONJs Teresa Giudices Biggest Fights With Joe, Melissa Gorga">&larr;
