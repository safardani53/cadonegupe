The arm compared to his head."</p><p>Someone else chimed in: "Looks like a kid's arm."</p><p>Others believed the snap was of Travis and Kylie, but not while at the alter.</p><p>One theorized: "Or it could just be a shoot they did. It seems they take family photos but don’t share them."</p><p>Another remarked: "They both like the thirst traps these days."</p><h2>WEDDING BELLS</h2><p>In July, Travis, 31, and Kylie, 25, sparked engagement rumors after fans stumbled upon what they believed was the pair's <a href=#>wedding registry</a>.</p><p>A list called "MOTHER GOOSE and CACTUS JACK's Registry" was uncovered, full of staggeringly expensive items.</p><p>The registry was dated for a wedding on December 10, 2022.</p><p>After the list was shared on an online thread, its title was changed to "?? ???? and ???? JACK's Registry."</p><p>Fans pointed out that Stormi often calls Kylie Mother Goose, and she has used it in several posts.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cactus Jack is the name of Travis' brand for his merchandise.</p><p>The URL for the page is "jackgoose1."</p><p>Other fans claimed it was a "dead giveaway" that the list is full of items of luxury furniture priced up to $500,000.</p><p>The people behind the registry are asking for items like a $500,000 Baccarat Zenuth chandelier, a $390,000 Daum crystal tropical peacock, a $255,000 Lui Lei armoire, and a $75,0000 Meissen sea life chess set.</p><p>A fan wrote: "The dead giveaway is the TICKET PRICE some of these Knick knacks come with, dayum!</p><p>Who else would be able to afford these gifts but their friends & family?"</p><p>Kylie and Travis have previously talked about getting married, with the rap star&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">saying in 2018 that he wants to pop the question</a>.</p><p>He told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a>: "We'll get married soon. I just gotta sturdy up — I gotta propose in a fire way."</p><p>At the time, the duo were only parents to their daughter but have since welcomed their second child, a baby boy born in February 2022.</p><h2>NAME GAME</h2><p>Neither Kylie nor Travis has yet to release the name of their son or post photos of his face.</p><p>The pair initially announced that his name was Wolf but retracted the moniker shortly afterward, claiming it "didn't fit him."</p><p>Many think the switch was due to drama between Kylie's former BFF,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tammy Hembrow</a>, whose 6-year-old son also has the name Wolf.</p><p>However, Kylie explained during an appearance on &nbsp;<a href=#>The Late Late Show with James Corden</a> earlier this month that she hasn't made any legal changes just yet.</p><p>"It's still Wolf. His password's still Wolf," the young mom admitted, though she plans to change that.</p><p>"But that isn't going to be his name. We're just waiting," she said.</p><p>"How long are you going to wait?" the talk show host asked.</p><p>Kylie explained that Travis could not decide and continued to change his mind about their son's name.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Fans have been throwing in their guesses as to what the youngster's moniker could be, suggesting names such as Butterfly, Cloudi, and Jacques - a nod to his father's birth name.</p><p>The latest theory is that his <a href=#>name is Snowy</a>, after hearing <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a>'s daughter, True, four, blurted out the moniker on last week's season two premiere of The Kardashians.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/travis-scott-kylie-jenner-seen-757582315-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/travis-scott-stormi-webster-kylie-740563491-6.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/www-instagram-com-p-ce-741547311-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huY2Z%2FcYOTaKKaqpSWwKm1wKdkraqRq7a0edKcpq2sXaDGrbXEZqGepp6av26%2FxJypnqxdqL2wwNOipaBlk6HCpns%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-heather-burns-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Heather Burns Dating Now">&larr;
