She kicked off her career in the theater world of New York City in the late-1950s before she began to land roles in hit movies in the 1990s, per her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb profile</a>. Some of her early roles included parts in&nbsp;Alice, Scent of a Woman, The Age of Innocence,&nbsp;and others. However, when the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>now 93-year-old</a> wasn’t busy working on the set of exciting movies and TV shows, she was a devoted wife and mother. Keep reading to learn more about her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two marriages</a> and her only child!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/June-Squibb-Family-SS-embed-1.jpg><h2>Who Is&nbsp;June Squibb’s Husband?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>The Oscar-nominated starlet has been married not once, but twice. Her first marriage was to a man named&nbsp;<strong>Edward Sostek</strong>, which lasted from 1953 until their split in 1959. Later, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>June married</a> an acting teacher by the name of&nbsp;<strong>Charles Kakatsakis</strong>. Although it is unclear when she married Charles, their marriage lasted until <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his death</a> in 1999.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“He taught me how to work. I don’t mean physically labor. I mean delivering what is needed in a part when it is needed,” her reportedly said of her late second husband, per IMDb. “You can’t just depend on instinct; it might not show up when you need it.” Not much else is known about their marriage, as June lives a relatively private life out of the spotlight. Although she has done many interview throughout her career, she primarily focuses on only talking about her work as an actress.</p><h2>June Squibb’s Only Son</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/June-Squibb-Family-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>In Mar. 1970, June and Charles welcomed their only son,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Harry Kakatsakis</strong></a>. Their adult child followed in his parents footsteps and went on to pursue a career in Hollywood. Harry is not only and actor, but also a director. Some of his projects listed on his IMDb include: Admissions (2011), What Future (2013) and Somewhere to Run.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The&nbsp;Admissions&nbsp;director has worked with many notable actors in his career, including <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Succession</a>‘s&nbsp;<strong>James Cromwell</strong>. He has also wrote a few short films, per his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>official website</a>, including&nbsp;In My Country. He proudly boasts that he is the son of “Academy Award nominated actress and star of <strong>Alexander Payne</strong>‘s Nebraska, June Squibb.” Harry’s website also features one sweet photo of him alongside his mother from 2010.</p><h2>What Is June Squibb Known For?</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>June is a Hollywood legend in her own right. Throughout her career she was spoken about acting, the skills it takes to succeed in Hollywood, and more. A few of her recent works include:&nbsp;Summer 03, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Palmer</a>, Hubie Halloween,&nbsp;and HBO’s&nbsp;Girls. During a 2014 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CNN</a> June opened up about her experience being nominated for an Oscar in her later years. “It’s different, God knows – and I certainly was never nominated for an Academy Award before – but it’s fun. I’m enjoying it tremendously,” she quipped at the time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>She also revealed what her journey as an actress has been like and how she got her start in New York City. “It was never a question of wanting. I always thought of myself as I am an actress. I went from Illinois to the Cleveland Playhouse and worked there for five years. And I went to New York from there. … I went there in ’56, and I was on Broadway by ‘59. I think I did five Broadway shows while I was there,” June said. “I did everything – off-Broadway, stock, anything you can possibly do.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>She concluded the interview by noting that choosing to work as an actress has had its pros and cons. “It’s been a wonderful life. Of course, it’s difficult – it’s probably the hardest career you could ever pick,” she shared. “But I’ve had a wonderful career; I’ve really worked a lot. I went to New York and started working right away. So I was one of the lucky ones in that respect.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mupZ5lo6bCqq7BZp2apZmhxm6BkG1pcWxlZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-get-away-with-murder-annalise-sam-cheating-lila-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Annalise Confronts Sam After Naked Pic  Hollywood Life">&larr;
