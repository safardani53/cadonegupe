Check out the comedian's full dating history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:image/webp;base64><p>Comedian and Saturday Night Live alum <a href=#>Pete Davidson</a> hasn't always been open about every relationship. But in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">candid interview</a> with Charlamagne Tha God back in 2020, the Staten Island native discussed his past romances and confessed how much they tend to overshadow his professional life. Still, he mentioned that he felt "very fortunate and lucky" to have dated "really wonderful, beautiful, cool, talented women.”</p><p>So, who are <a href=#>Pete Davidson's famous exes</a>? And who is he dating now? Let's dive in...</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pete dated Carly Aquilino from 2014 to 2015.</h2><p>This was before Pete rose to fame, so the exact timeline of their relationship is unclear. However, we do know that they were close when they co-starred on MTV's Guy Code and Girl Code. He and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carly</a> knew each other since 2013, so it's possible that their romance started even earlier. But unfortunately, the comedians split up in 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Despite the split, it turns out that they're still on good terms. Pete told Charlamagne in his 2020 interview: "We're cool friends. We actually hang out all the time ... She's honestly one of the coolest chicks I've ever met."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pete dated Cazzie David for two years.</h2><p>After his split from Carly, Pete moved on to <a href=#>Cazzie</a>, the creator of the web series Eighty-Sixed. The happy couple made several public appearances together and sang each other's praises in their interviews. For instance, Pete once noted that she played an important role in helping him stay sober and Cazzie revealed that her father — the legendary Larry David — approved of him.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>: "He really loves that I'm dating a comedian. He loves it because he feels like the only people he can talk to are people who also make jokes. It worked out very well."</p><p>Sadly, they broke up in 2018. He revealed in his interview on Open Late with Peter Rosenberg: “We’re not together anymore."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pete got engaged to Ariana Grande in June 2018, just weeks after they started dating.</h2><p>Not long after his split from Cazzie, Pete started to date <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a>, who had also recently split from late rapper Mac Miller. Their relationship seemed to progress at the speed of light, because they went from hanging out and being flirty on social media to sporting matching tattoos and getting engaged in a matter of weeks. This was only a few days after they made their relationship Instagram official.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Pete announced the news a few weeks after Ariana was spotted with an engagement ring. On June 20, 2018, while on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, he said: "I feel like I won a contest. So sick."</p><p>But their engagement didn't last for long. The singer and the comic called it off after four months and split up in October 2018. Then in November, Ariana released her breakup anthem "Thank U, Next," which, of course, mentioned Pete (and the rest of her famous exes). Still, both she and Pete claimed that they had no hard feelings toward each other.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On SNL, Pete shared: “I know some of you are curious about the breakup, but the truth is, it’s nobody’s business and sometimes things just don’t work out, and that’s OK. She’s a wonderful, strong person and I genuinely wish her all the happiness in the world."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pete dated Kate Beckinsale in 2019.</h2><p>They were seen flirting and sticking close to each other at Netflix’s Golden Globes afterparty in January 2019, which was more than enough to spark new dating rumors. But Pete and <a href=#>Kate</a> didn't confirm the relationship until they were seen having a full make-out session during a March 2019 Rangers game in New York.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Kate mentioned that being with Pete was worth having to deal with the extra spotlight. Meanwhile, Pete had to address people's concerns about their 20-year age difference. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>: "Apparently people have a crazy fascination with our age difference. But it doesn't really bother us."</p><p>Just four months after they started dating, it was reported that he and the actress called it quits, although neither of them publicly confirmed the news.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pete reportedly also had a fling Margaret Qualley in 2019.</h2><p>Us Weekly revealed that the comic was already seeing someone else by August of 2019. He reportedly started dating Once Upon a Time in Hollywood actress <a href=#>Margaret Qualley</a> and a source <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a>: "They’ve been seeing each other for a couple of months and Margaret is really excited about him."</p><p>That same month, they were seen sitting near each other at the Venice Film Festival.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although neither of them confirmed that they were in a relationship, they were spotted holding hands in September 2019, while they were in Venice. Also, Margaret’s mom, Andie MacDowell, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> that her daughter and Pete had “a beautiful relationship."</p><p>Sadly, the couple broke up that October.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pete then started dating Kaia Gerber in 2019.</h2><p>About five seconds after his breakup with Margaret, Pete was romantically linked to model and actress <a href=#>Kaia Gerber</a> in October 2019. One source revealed that they were trying to keep a "low profile," but they weren't too successful. They were actually spotted holding hands on a few occasions and were seen making out during their getaway in Miami. However, <a href=#>their whirlwind romance came to an end</a> in January 2020.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Pete later reflected in his 2020 interview with Charlamagne The God: "She’s very young, and I’m f--king going through a lot and it was before I went to rehab. It’s just like, she should be having fun. She shouldn’t have to worry about some dude that just has issues and s--t. She should be enjoying her work.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pete was caught getting cozy with Phoebe Dynevor in 2021.</h2><p>The <a href=#>Bridgerton</a> star and Pete reportedly <a href=#>dated from around April to August 2021</a>, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>. A source told the outlet the English actress and the New York–based comedian were "happy with each other." They made their first public appearance together at Wimbeldon in London in July 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But sadly, things didn't last. A source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> after <a href=#>Phoebe</a> and Pete's breakup: "The long distance made it very difficult. They had fun, but it wasn't sustainable being so far apart. It was great while it lasted, but they both agreed it was best to move on."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pete dated Kim Kardashian for nine months from 2021 to 2022.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In a relationship that shocked the world and caused mass Hollywood chaos, Pete started dating reality star <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> in October 2021 until their relationship ended in August 2022. While the duo initially had mutual friends, it was Kim's appearance on Saturday Night Live in October that cemented their relationship potential.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Sadly, their relationship <a href=#>came to an end</a> by August, but not after several shared red0carpet moments that included the White House Correspondents' Dinner and the Met Gala. A source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> after their breakup that long distance played a role, but that the two had "a lot of love and respect for each other."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pete briefly dated model Emily Ratajkowski in 2022.</h2><p>Following his split from Kim and <a href=#>Emily</a>'s own divorce from husband Sebastian Bear-McClard, it appears that they found each other. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> reported in November 2022 that the duo were "seeing each other" following reports from gossip outlet Deux Moi where they were spotted on a date in New York City in October 2022.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But by December, it was reported that the two were already done.
