The bus lane is set to operate 24 hours a day.</p><p>After over 100 drivers generated around £10,000 in fines between 7-8am this morning, later in the afternoon some 87 vehicles went into the bus lane in 30 minutes - potentially creating £5220 in fines.</p><p>A West Midlands Police van, council vehicles, Uber drivers and recycling trucks were among those liable to be stung with charges.</p><h2>CASH COW FINES</h2><p>Last month it was revealed hundreds of people in UK cities are being stung by straying into bus lanes.</p><p>Cambridge County Council raked in more than £1.8million in fines in a year from March last year.</p><p>And in 2017/18 Reading drivers forked out nearly £3million for going into bus lanes, with Belfast motorists losing more than £4million in four years for the same offence.</p><p>Councils have been accused of using bus lane fines as cash cows, with former Transport Secretary Chris Grayling telling the AA in 2018 Government would look into exploitation concerns.</p><p>Gym worker Luke Imlack, 32, fears the bus lane - which is only around 25m in length - would add half an hour to his daily commute.</p><p>He said: “I live near the airport so it’s already a 12 mile drive for me to get to work. This is going to make it so much more difficult to get to work.</p><p>“I’m not going to pay it - it’s ludicrous. The council should have let the businesses around here know because we are the ones that use it.</p><p>“When the congestion charge comes in next year then I’m not going to work in the city. It will be unbearable.</p><p>“The warning sign should be red, not blue. No one will notice it.”</p><h2>'IT'S OUT OF ORDER'</h2><p>One Birmingham motorist snapped in the bus lane today said: “It’s out of order. I’ve been coming this way for years and I had no idea it had changed.</p><p>“I only realised it was now a bus lane when I was actually on the road and saw the lettering on the tarmac.</p><p>“By then it was too late. Once you’re on there you don’t have a second chance.”</p><p>Sheepcote Street, at the back of the Arena Birmingham, was a popular way for motorists to access the city’s busy Broad Street.</p><p>But today drivers were greeted with the giant words Bus Lane painted in white lettering on to a bright red road surface.</p><p>To emphasise the message, Birmingham City Council last night posted on social media saying: 'STARTS TOMORROW: Cross the line, pay the fine.'</p><h2>DRIVERS BEWARE</h2><p>A Birmingham City Council spokesperson said: “Bus lane enforcement cameras are an important tool in helping to keep the city moving but ideally there would be no need to issue penalty notices at all if motorists did not drive in bus lanes.</p><p>"With regard to the bus lane in Sheepcote Street, this has been publicised extensively through local media and social media, while there is also clear signage warning motorists of the new measures.</p><p>"The message therefore couldn’t be clearer: cross the line, pay the fine.”</p><p>Birmingham's 18 miles of bus lanes and bus-only roads saw motorists coughing up £1.36 million in fines during 2017/2018.</p><p>In 2018 there were 24 bus lane cameras operating in the city - compared with 12 in 2016 - and in the first three months of last year 2,000 bus lane fines were per week on average.</p><p>Locals commenting on the council’s Facebook post were less than impressed with the new bus-only route.</p><p>Malcolm Donaldson wrote: “It’s got to the point where I shall just avoid driving to town with all these traps, because that’s what they are.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>Dave Erfani added: “It’s a joke. Totally designed to catch people out.”</p><p>And Keith Ward commented: “Council is getting desperate now. They’ll step on anyone to get money. Watch your backs, people.”</p><p>Last week we told how a dad was slapped with two £100 fines in two hours after asking for directions and filling up petrol.</p><p>The Sun Online revealed how <a href=#>Ryan Smith, 33, became the ninth person to claim to be ripped-off at East Midlands Airport.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000518315202.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000518313626.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000518315206.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000518313624.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000518214240.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000518214309.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000518214255.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Double decker bus turned into 'convertible' after entire roof ripped off by low bridge in Fauldhouse</span><p><b>We pay for your stories!
