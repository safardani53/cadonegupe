Look at me, I had all that hair and a beard. I can’t even grow one now. I’ve not even got eyebrows anymore! I still have a head of hair though.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Championship</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG-0013jpg-JS813071145.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/7677670b-2a33-46d4-82d9-285dbcede3deJPG-JS813071253.jpg><p>Twenty-eight years his junior, that is something I cannot boast — but there are also many younger managers who lack something else he has in abundance.</p><p>And that is a huge charismatic personality with an ability to make average footballers feel as confident as Lionel Messi for 90 minutes.</p><p>It is no coincidence <a href=#>Warnock </a>has won eight promotions in his career — four of them to the top flight.</p><p>He said: “It used to be the fashion to have older managers and then the trend moved to younger coaches.&nbsp;</p><p>“They talk about tactics, formations and what have you — yet 95 percent of this job is and always will be man-management.&nbsp;</p><p>“Pep Guardiola knows what he’s doing but the biggest thing he does is get the players to believe in what he says. That’s why he’s successful.”</p><p>It is almost as though Warnock and Hodgson keep coming out of retirement in their race to be the oldest-ever manager with the ex-England boss currently setting the record at Palace, aged 75.</p><p>Warnock laughs: “Roy wasn’t daft there. I’d come back into football with that squad.”</p><p>But the Yorkshireman has watched as clubs like Tottenham and Leicester have sacked experienced and successful coaches like Antonio Conte and Brendan Rodgers — while he thinks West Ham have been sensible to stick with David Moyes.</p><p>He said: “You just need an older head sometimes. I look at some of the decisions clubs make and who they’ve appointed as a caretaker. I’m thinking ‘This is silly.’ Anyone who has a clue about football knows it’s not going to be a success. It baffles me.&nbsp;</p><p>“That’s why there’ll always be a job for me every February, March and April if I keep my health.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Warnock on autographs and selfies</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>NEIL WARNOCK always drums into his players the importance of taking time to sign autographs … because he does not want fans left heartbroken like he was.</p><p>The legendary boss — when he was just eight — was snubbed by a Sheffield United player after waiting an hour and a half in the pouring rain after a match.</p><p>He said: “I was waiting until quarter past six and asked this player, who I won’t name, if I could have his autograph and he replied, ‘Sorry I’m in a rush, I got so much on’ before running across the street. I cried my eyes out. I never refuse autographs or selfies. I hate players with headphones on going straight in or out and not doing that for the genuine fans.</p><p>“How long does it take to sign a few autographs and take a few photos?</p><p>“I’ve just had an email sent to me from a fan with photo of me and him when he was a kid when I managed here in the 1990s. What players must realise is that doing something like that is a moment these fans remember forever.”</p><p>“When Conte made those comments about Tottenham before he left, people were saying he just did so because he wanted to get out — but he spoke the truth. I agreed.</p><p>“Brendan will benefit from leaving Leicester because when I look around I don’t think there are many good managers at the minute and he is one so will get a decent job.</p><p>“I’m chuffed for Moyesy, though, he’s done a good job at West Ham.”</p><p>Warnock always rates the three months he spent at Rotherham in 2016 when he led them to Championship safety as his greatest achievement but he believes that will be eclipsed if he keeps Huddersfield up.&nbsp;</p><p>He said: “We had leaders in that dressing room that you’d want to be in the trenches with — whereas we haven’t got a lot of talkers here.</p><p>“But these lads compensate for that by their willingness to learn and listen to what we say.&nbsp;</p><p>“When we had our first team meeting, I asked my assistant Ronnie Jepson to sit to the side of the room and look at how many of the players were looking down at the floor or up at the ceiling or glancing at their watches.</p><p>“Ronnie told me, ‘Apart from one player, the whole group was glued to you.’ I knew then they were relieved to be getting our help and we had something to work with.</p><p>“There were early hiccups — conceding silly goals and a couple of 4-0 defeats to Burnley and Coventry.</p><p>“Even against Burnley, I learned a lot about three or four players because we had asked for them to do certain things and they couldn’t do it.</p><p>“We brought in three or four players that had been bombed out. Their contracts were up and had been told they could go. I was thinking we can use these — so I put my arms around them and said, ‘I’ll get you a contract somewhere else if you play for me and <a href=#>Huddersfield</a> don’t want you.’ And they’re playing out of their skins.</p><p>“Then we’ve got young lads like Jack Rudoni, who has taken a lot on board and will be an exciting player. And we’ve got the experience of players like Danny Ward back in the team.”</p><p>The 1-1 draw at Sunderland last time out pleased Warnock —&nbsp;although frustratingly this week he received confirmation from the PGMOL that the Tom Lees disallowed goal should have stood.&nbsp;</p><p>Warnock shrugs his shoulders and sighs: “That’s another two points we’ve missed out on because of refs.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Warnock on Sheffield United's promotion</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>NEIL WARNOCK believes the best signing Paul Heckingbottom has made at Sheffield United was bringing in his assistant Stuart McCall.</p><p>The ex-Blades boss and boyhood fan was delighted to watch them clinch promotion with a 2-0 in over West Brom on Wednesday.</p><p>And Warnock said: "Paul has done so well. They’ve had a lot of injuries. People forget that. They've had a couple of sticky patches but have just stuck at it and I'm delighed.</p><p>"Stuart McCall, his assistant, was the best signing he ever made because he has seen and done it all and is such a nice man who knows what he’s doing.</p><p>"He’s just that kind of person you need in your ear when you're a bit doubtful about one or two things.</p><p>"They've already been written off and tipped to be relegated. It'll all depend what happens with the owners and how much support he gets.</p><p>"When we got promoted, I didn't get much support. We barely spent a penny. So let's wait and see how much help Paul gets."</p><p>Huddersfield were cited for making a complaint to the EFL regarding Burnley fielding a weakened team against fellow strugglers Reading after promotion had been wrapped up.</p><p>But the Terriers boss said: “We didn’t make a complaint. I simply said in a press conference it’s a shame we didn’t get to play Burnley after they’d been promoted. It’s just bad luck!”</p><p>Yet Warnock knows everything is in his team’s hands with three games left. After tomorrow’s trip to his ex-team Cardiff, who are all but safe, they finish with two home games against already-promoted Sheffield United and then potentially a huge game with Reading.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He said: “The biggest ingredient for a scrap like this is belief. You must believe you can win and if we play to our top standard we can beat anyone. We’re going to give it our best shot.” And that you can be sure of.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/8d541dc1-d65d-4c39-8a0e-50d03a287926.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/BLP_07_NEIL_WARNOCKjpg-JS813046055.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Warnock goes on a UK tour ...
