Some family traditions are nice, especially around the holidays, and can make special occasions feel that much more special.</p><p>Even unique family recipes that only stay within your clan can feel like a little secret you hold near and dear. You, your siblings, children, parents, grandparents, and grandkids' are all in on something - and that's pretty cool. In fact, a lot of great restaurants, businesses, and food products were spawned from ultra-secret family recipes that were honed and fine-tuned over the years. I know I'm a sucker for cooking shows where someone waxes on about their family's trademark dish.</p><p>Whether they spill the beans about the secret ingredients or not, you can tell that a lot of love went into making it and their eyes light up when discussing the special dish. For one Tumblr user's mom, it was her meatloaf.</p><p>They went on to talk about how when they were a little kid, their favorite food was this meatloaf, and that their mom's was the only one that they would ever eat. In fact, they went so far as to say they didn't like anyone else's.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>That to me says that this meatloaf must've been really something special. Growing up, I loved my mom's pate (burek), an Albanian dish comprised of layers of baked fillo dough and a homemade rolled dough crust. Inside you could put whatever you wanted: my absolute favorite is pumpkin with heavy cream. You can also put spinach and feta cheese, or just cheese, or tomatoes - believe it or not some people even make it with poison ivy.</p><p>I guess they prepare it in a way so it doesn't make your esophagus itch, but what I'm getting at is that even though my mom's pate is inarguably the greatest that has ever been made (dugh) just like my grandma's cheesesteaks (and now my uncle and his wife and their children's recipe) I still like other pates and cheesesteaks.</p><p>But not this person, only their mom's meatloaf would do. She must've known it was a good recipe, however, because she didn't share it with anyone else.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>In fact, she wouldn't even reveal it to her own child until they were 19 years old and when she did, she made them vow to not tell anyone else the recipe. Her child kept that promise...until they came out of the closet to her.</p><p>That's where the cons of "traditional" families can really come into play. Sadly, prejudice comes along with those traditions for some, and it did in the case of this Tumblr user.</p><p>Their mother was "super f***ing homophobic and abusive to" them when they came out as gay. I can only imagine the heartbreak one suffers when they're rejected by their own mother for simply stating who they are. It could definitely make someone want to lash out in some way, or enact revenge of some kind.</p><p>So they decided to get back at their mom the best way they knew how: by outing her "super-secret" meatloaf recipe to the entire world. Here it is.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit</a></figure><p>It was posted to Reddit's r/tumblr subreddit, where it kicked off a conversation of other people serving up their own meatloaf recipes. Pretty much everyone was in support of OP for getting back at their mom in this brilliant way. But most importantly, the web was gifted with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Frankenloaf"</a> recipe that included aspects of all the different popular meatloaf recipes on the internet.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a class=embedly-card href=#>Card</a></figure><p>While the "Revenge Loaf" story might be a good one, how does it actually taste? Well, once word spread out of the Revenge Loaf on Twitter, folks were all in a hurry to try it out, even if they felt like the recipe had way too much meat involved. However, one user who made and ate it attested to its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">deliciousness, even if it was a giant meat wad</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>When it comes to the shape of the meat, if you're going to make a big stack of "Revenge Loaf", or "Spite Loaf" as some took to calling it, why not get a little creative with its structure? It can't be a dinner recipe born out of vengeance and just look like a regular old log of meat and various other ingredients, now can it?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Will you be making Revenge Loaf for your next dinner party? Or maybe cooking one up as a goodbye meal for a cheating ex or someone else who has done you dirty? Actually, I think I'm going to bookmark my own article in case I need to just do that down the line.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnbyuu8%2Bhppuhk2K6sLnSZqSemaShvKKyjKucnKGgmg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./weird-celebrity-baby-names-rainbow-aurora-pics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="[PHOTOS] Weird Celebrity Baby Names  Hollywood Kids With Unique Names  Hollywood Life">&larr;
