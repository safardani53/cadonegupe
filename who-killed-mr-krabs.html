It is known for starring as the money-driven manager of the burger joint, where the lead character SpongeBob works as a burger flipper.</p><p>He is also the father to a whale called Pearl, who he loves from the bottom of his heart.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Trial_of_SpongeBob_SquarePants></span>The Trial of SpongeBob SquarePants<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Trial of SpongeBob SquarePants seems to be an activity that can be set as a class challenge at school. The main document that fans have come across is a two-page PDF.</p><p>The PDF details Mr. Krabs’ death and a list of evidence and witnesses testimonies surrounding the case.</p><p>On its own, the document seems to be quite mysterious and a little disturbing. However, another version of the same document exists.</p><p>The second is an 11-page PDF that includes worksheets and instructions that specifically mention splitting a class into teams to work as the defense or prosecution.</p><p>The aim of the activity seems to be to get students to examine the evidence on show, ignoring what they already know about the SpongeBob series, to determine who really killed Mr. Krabs.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Mr_Crabs_Die></span>How did Mr. Crabs Die?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Killed-Mr.-Krabs-pic.jpg><p>In the Trial of SpongeBob SquarePants document, Mr. Krabs is found dead inside his Krusty Krab restaurant and his throat has been cut. The coroner concluded that the wound was caused by a metal spatula.</p><p>A similar spatula was found next to Mr. Krabs’ body and was covered in his blood.</p><p>Mr. Krabs also had signs of blunt-force trauma on the back of his head. On top of that, the floor of the Krusty Krab was slippery as it was covered in cooking grease.</p><p>Several footprints were found in the grease including SpongeBob’s but his footprints were not in the pool of Mr. Krabs’ blood.</p><p>There was no sign of a break-in at the restaurant but the Krusty Krab’s cash register was empty and Mr. Krabs’ safe was found open with the secret recipe for the Krabby Patty missing.</p><p>Mr. Krabs also had a small cut on his claw that had begun to heal which had been determined to have happened several weeks earlier.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Actually_Killed_Mr_Crabs></span>Who Actually Killed Mr. Crabs?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Killed-Mr.-Krabs-.jpg><p>In the activity, the identity of Mr. Krabs’ killer is left up to whoever is taking part in the challenge. It is up to the prosecution and defense teams to plead that SpongeBob is innocent or guilty.</p><p>However, taking a look at the evidence ourselves, we can see that there are a number of possibilities about how Mr. Krabs met his fate.</p><p>The slippery floor could have caused him to fall and cut his throat by accident.</p><p>Although this doesn’t explain the empty safe and cash register.</p><p>This is where the blame shifts towards Plankton, Mr. Krabs’ long-time rival.&nbsp; Not long after Mr. Krabs’ death, he began selling burgers with a very similar recipe to the legendary Krabby Patty.</p><p>To complicate matters, two days after Plankton began selling the burgers, he went to the bank and paid off the remainder of SpongeBob’s house loan.</p><p>The document also informs us that SpongeBob has never been given a raise in all his years working at the Krusty Krab which made him disgruntled.</p><p>This leads to the possible theory that SpongeBob and Plankton worked together to steal the Krabby Patty recipe.</p><p>Mr. Krabs’ death could potentially have been an accident on the slippery floor all along.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mr_Krabs_is_Way_Older_than_you_think></span>Mr. Krabs is Way Older than you think!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>When you look at SpongeBob, you may think his age is indeterminate. But do you know his age has actually been revealed on the show through a picture of his hard-earned license?</p><p>The picture of a document shows SpongeBob was born on the 14th of July, 1986.</p><p>His boss, Mr. Krabs, was born on the 30th of November, 1942, making the crab almost 75 years old.</p><p>But age doesn’t matter, and Mr. Krabs was still seen running a restaurant like a boss.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Show_is_Created_by_a_Marine_Biologist></span>The Show is Created by a Marine Biologist<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>SpongeBob SquarePants was started in 1996 by Stephen Hillenburg. Interestingly, he is a marine artist.</p><p>Hillenburg graduated from Humboldt State University with his bachelor’s degree in marine resource planning and interpretation in 1984.</p><p>Afterward, he took his knowledge to teach at an institute.</p><p>Soon he switched his career path and enrolled in the California Institute of the Arts to learn about animation.</p><p>The rest is history.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=SpongeBob_had_a_Different_Name></span>SpongeBob had a Different Name<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>When the show was created, SpongeBob was not SpongeBob but SpongeBoy. He wanted the protagonist of the show to be different from others.</p><p>The first version of him was an amorphous shape, similar to a sponge. But the director was inspired by looking at a kitchen sponge to give him his signature square shape.</p><p>This version of SpongeBob was not exactly like the final iteration. When SpongeBob was SpongeBoy, he was more accessorized.</p><p>He wore a green baseball cap, which the maker decided to toss before filming the series. Hillenburg was convinced to ditch the original name of the character when he found that it was copyrighted by a mop company.</p><p>Thus, SpongeBoy became SpongeBob.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=SpongeBob_is_the_Ex-Presidents_Favorite_TV_Character></span>SpongeBob is the Ex-President’s Favorite TV Character<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In one of the interviews with Barack Obama, he got up close and personal and mentioned that SpongeBob is his favorite TV character. Mr. Obama added that he is still very fond of the cartoon.</p><p>This is such a huge honor for a show that has won the world over with a multitude of fans.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed this article.
