Due to the staggeringly low amounts,&nbsp;members of <a href=#>the SAG-AFTRA acting union called out</a> the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) for refusing to<a href=#> compromise on better terms regarding residual checks</a> during contract negotiations. As a result, the SAG actors went on strike in July 2023 shortly after the Writers Guild of America <a href=#>stood up for similar causes.</a></p><p class=p1>Keep reading to find out how much the stars really make in residuals:</p><h3 class=p2><b>Mandy Moore</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Milo-Ventimiglia-Mandy-Moore-This-Is-Us.jpg><p class=p1>Moore has received<a href=#> 81-cent checks for streaming residuals</a> of&nbsp;<i>This Is Us</i>, the Emmy-winning drama that she starred in between 2016 and 2022. “I was talking with my business manager <a href=#>who said he’s received a residual</a> for a penny and two pennies,”&nbsp;she told&nbsp;<i>The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;</i>on the picket lines in July 2023.</p><h3 class=p2><b>Robert Carradine</b></h3><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Lizzie McGuire</a>&nbsp;</i>alum — who played <strong><a href=#>Hilary Duff</a></strong>’s onscreen father on the Disney Channel series — once received <a href=#>a residual check in August 2019&nbsp;for $0</a>. While Carradine did not reveal what program the check was for, it had been sent by Walt Disney Pictures. (In addition to <i>Lizzie, </i>Carradine has starred in several other Disney projects.)</p><p class=p1>Carradine’s&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Lizzie McGuire&nbsp;</i>costars</a> have also seen similarly low residuals.&nbsp;<strong>Davida Williams</strong>, who played cheerleader Claire Miller, revealed on her&nbsp;<i>Lizzie McGuire</i>&nbsp;recap podcast in March 2023 that she usually gets a sum of $3.50 or less.</p><p class=p1>“It used to be, like, you’d have to take this huge stack of checks every month for residuals over to the bank and deposit them,” <a href=#><strong>Jake Thomas</strong></a> (a.k.a. Lizzie’s little brother Matt) chimed in at the time. “But the huge stack would be like, ‘Oh, this is a massive stack. This is $8.’”</p><h3 class=p2><b>Kendrick Sampson</b></h3><p class=p1>Sampson, who starred as Nathan on HBO’s<a href=#>&nbsp;<i>Insecure&nbsp;</i></a>between 2018 and 2021, received<a href=#> 56 residual checks in July 2023</a>. However, they only totaled $86, which was not enough to cover his monthly bills, which he shared on Instagram.</p><h3 class=p2><b>William Stanford Davis</b></h3><p class=p1>Davis, who is known for his role as Mr. Johnson on ABC’s&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Abbott Elementary</i></a>, revealed via Instagram in July 2023 that he once <a href=#>got a check for 5 cents</a>. “The postage, the paper,&nbsp;everything costs more than that. That’s what they think of us as actors,” he said at the time. “This is why&nbsp;we’re on strike for better wages, for better residuals [and] for a piece of the subscription.”</p><h3 class=p2><b>Kimiko Glenn</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/How-Much-Celebrities-Earn-in-Residual-Checks-by-the-Numbers-Kimiko-Glenn-Orange-Is-the-new-black.jpg><p class=p1>Glenn, who played inmate&nbsp;Brook Soso on&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Orange Is The New Black</i></a>, showed off a <a href=#>handful of residual paystubs via TikTok</a> in July 2023. They only amounted to $27.</p><h3 class=p2><b>Constance Marie</b></h3><p class=p1>Marie shared a copy of her paystubs via <a href=#>TikTok</a> in July 2023, noting she’s gotten between 3 cents and 74 cents in residuals for repeat viewings of Freeform’s&nbsp;<i>Switched at Birth.&nbsp;</i>(Marie was<a href=#> one of the main characters on the<b>&nbsp;</b>show</a> for five years, even sustaining an injury from excessive American Sign Language use.)</p><h3 class=p2><b>Heather Matarazzo</b></h3><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Princess Diaries</a>&nbsp;</i>star clapped back at <a href=#>TikTok</a> fans’ assertions that she was rich by showing her residuals. Several of the checks were less than 10 cents each.</p><h3 class=p2><b>Jana Schmieding</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/How-Much-Celebrities-Earn-in-Residual-Checks-by-the-Numbers-Jana-Schmieding-Bev-Reservation-Dogs.jpg><p class=p1>“To fans of my character Bev on&nbsp;<i>Reservation Dogs</i>, here’s a peek behind the IHS counter at what part of my residuals looks like for acting on a show that I love,” Schmieding <a href=#>tweeted</a> in July 2023. “I pull in $.03 each quarter for UNLIMITED worldwide streams on fx/hulu/DISNEY.”</p><h3 class=p2><b>Brandee Evans</b></h3><p class=p1>Evans, who is best known for her role as Mercedes Woodine on&nbsp;<i>P-Valley</i>, got three <a href=#>residual checks</a> in July 2023 for $3.99, $4.67 and 1 cent, respectively.</p><h3 class=p1><b>Greer Grammer</b></h3><p class=p1>Grammer, who played Lissa Miller on MTV’s <i>Awkward</i>, primarily gets her residual checks for episodes of the five-season sitcom. In August 2023, she <a href=#>opened up a handful of paystubs</a> via TikTok.</p><p class=p1>“<i>Awkward</i>, ‘Are You there God, It’s Me, Jenna.’ Total gross: .80 cents. Oh, actually that’s what this [paystub] says but the check is actually for .50 cents,” she said, before revealing additional checks for $.63, $.60, $.30 and $.68.</p><h3><strong>Billy Porter</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/How-Much-Do-Actors-Earn-in-Residuals-Billy-Porter-Pose.jpg><p class=p1>“I’m not trying to get any sympathy, this is the truth of it, my residual checks were six cents,” Porter told the U.K.’s <a href=#><i>Evening Standard </i></a>in August 2023 of reruns for his FX series, <i>Pose. </i>“I’m still an artist and artists are still freelance workers. So <i>Pose</i> has been over now since 2021, I don’t get no more money from that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>He added: “I’m supposed to, which is why we’re striking. I’m supposed to be getting money from that, but I ain’t.”</p><h3>Aaron Paul</h3><p>“I don’t get a piece from Netflix on Breaking Bad to be totally honest and that’s insane to me,” Paul said while on the picket line in September 2023. “I think a lot of these streamers know that they have been getting away with not paying people a fair wage and now it’s time to pony up.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ%2Bor12iwqS0jJycpZ2Sp7a1tcSsZJ6ZoqN6qrqMq5ysoZSqrq15wqGcnKOjYq%2B6edOhnGampaKvpr7SaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./queen-of-the-south.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Queen of the South - latest Football news, transfer rumours, fixtures | The Sun">&larr;
