Make sure you buy the top sweatshirt dresses in 2023 that complement your body and style.</p><h3>Factors to Consider While Buying a Sweatshirt Dress</h3><p>Below is a list of top factors to consider when buying a sweatshirt dress that combines class with comfort:</p><h4>Fabric</h4><p>The first thing to consider when buying a sweatshirt dress is its fabric. Sweatshirt fabrics are available in different types of fabrics, including cotton, fleece, french terry, polyester, and sherpa. So, choose the fabric of sweatshirt dresses, depending on your location and the occasion you want to wear it on.</p><h4>Size</h4><p>Sweatshirt dresses are available in different sizes and lengths. The longest are the ones that reach below the knees. However, longer sweatshirt dresses are not as common as shorter ones. So, choose a size that compliments your physique and height. The most versatile size is the one that reaches the knees. It makes the legs look longer and fulfills the purpose of a dress.</p><h4>Comfort</h4><p>Sweatshirt dresses are supposed to make you look cute and chic without compromising their comfort. So, when you choose a sweatshirt dress, you should make sure it is comfortable to wear. Moreover, if you are buying a sweatshirt dress for colder weather, it should keep you warm.</p><h3>What Are the Different Types of Sweatshirts?</h3><p>Sweatshirts are of different styles and designs. Typically, sweatshirts are available in the following styles:</p><h4>Crewneck sweatshirt</h4><p>Crewneck sweatshirts are the classic style of sweatshirts. They are made of fabric slightly heavier than the t-shirt fabric. Typically, crewneck sweatshirts have a round and collarless neck design. These are cozy, comfy, and functional sweatshirts worn by both men and women. Moreover, they are usually warmer than t-shirts, so, perfect for wearing in colder months.</p><h4>Polo sweatshirt</h4><p>Polo sweatshirts are not as casual as crewneck sweatshirts. They resemble a polo shirt in terms of collar design. Moreover, they are mainly for men.</p><h4>Hoodies</h4><p>Imagine a sweatshirt with a hood with drawstrings attached. Hoodie sweatshirts are made for men and women. These hoodies are available in zipper and pullover designs. Moreover, they are made of cotton, polyester, or mixed fabric. A typical hoodie will have a kangaroo pocket in front to keep your hands warm on a cold day.</p><h4>Sweatshirt dresses</h4><p>Sweatshirt dresses are mainly for women. These are like longer sweatshirts that work as dresses. It means you don’t have to wear pants or skirts under them. Usually, these sweatshirt dresses are form-fitting. These dresses are perfect for occasions where a t-shirt or sweatshirt is more casual.</p><h3>What Are Sweatshirt Dresses Made Of?</h3><p>Sweatshirt dresses are usually made of the same fabrics that sweatshirts are made of. Typically, you will find sweatshirts made of the following fabrics:</p><h4>Polyester</h4><p>Polyester fabric wicks moisture better than cotton. It is less prone to shrinking and has a better sheen than natural fibers. If you want more polyester in your sweatshirt dresses, go for at least 60% polyester.</p><h4>Cotton</h4><p>Cotton is the most common fabric for sweatshirt dresses, and you can easily find 100% cotton sweatshirt dresses. It is a natural fiber, so it will fade over time. Moreover, it retains moisture, so it may not be suitable for hotter areas.</p><h4>Hemp</h4><p>Hemp is also a natural fiber that can be easily sourced organically. It is usually blended with cotton, which makes it more affordable. Since it is blended, it is more absorbent than cotton. Usually, 45-55% blended hemp with cotton is perfect.</p><h3>Sweatshirt Dresses Care Tips</h3><p>Buying sweatshirt dresses is fun, but you should know how to take care of these dresses to make them last longer. Some general care tips for sweatshirt dresses are as follows:</p><h4>Don’t overwash</h4><p>Most sweatshirt dresses are low maintenance. It means they don’t have to be washed as often as a t-shirt. Moreover, wearing a sweatshirt dress a few times before putting it in the laundry basket can help preserve the fabric. However, you should wear it a few times only if you are casually lounging in it. If you use the same dress for working out, you will need to wash it every time after the workout, or the odor will make everyone around you uncomfortable.</p><h4>Spot-treat stains instantly</h4><p>It is essential to spot-treat your sweatshirt dress immediately if you spill something on it. To do that, you should rinse the stained part under lukewarm water. Then, use some white vinegar on the spot to loosen it and let the vinegar soak in for about an hour. Lastly, machine-wash it on a cold cycle. Usually, it removes the stain, but if it persists, use hydrogen peroxide and let it sit for 10-15 minutes before rinsing it with lukewarm water.</p><h4>Avoid hot water</h4><p>Hot water is the ultimate enemy of wooly clothes and sweatshirt dresses. It can make the clothes shrink or become an irregular shape. Always wash such clothes in your machine on a cold cycle. Otherwise, you will end up with a sweatshirt dress that is one size smaller than your actual size.</p><h4>Shrink a big sweatshirt dress</h4><p>While hot water is a sweatshirt dress’ enemy in one scenario, it may be its best friend in another. For instance, you have a favorite sweatshirt dress, but it is way too big for you. You can shrink it by soaking it in extra hot water and then drying it in a dryer on high heat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwrc%2BpmKudnGTAuLHAraqhoaKpeqW%2BxKyqZmpf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./megan-fox-blonde-wig-photo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Megan Fox Blonde Wig Photo">&larr;
