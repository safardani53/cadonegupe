In December, the headpiece <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>left the Tower of London</a>, where it is stored with the other Crown Jewels, to undergo work to get it ready for the historic service in May.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The St. Edward Crown was first created for Charles II in 1661 and was a replacement for the previous crown that had been melted down in 1649. The palace said the original was thought to date back to the 11th-century royal saint, Edward the Confessor, who was the last Anglo-Saxon king of England.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">King Charles will then swap the St. Edward Crown for the less-heavy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Imperial State Crown</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, Queen Camilla will wear <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Queen Mary's Crown</a>. The spectacular sparkler is set with 2,200 diamonds and was first worn by Charles' great-grandmother Mary when she was crowned as Queen Consort beside her husband, King George V, in 1911.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The move marks the first time in recent history that a Queen Consort will use an existing crown for a coronation ceremony instead of commissioning something new. Buckingham Palace said the decision was made "in the interests of sustainability and efficiency," causes close to King Charles' heart.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Updates are being made to Queen Mary's Crown before Queen Camilla wears it at the coronation. Work is underway to reset the headpiece with the Cullinan III, IV and V diamonds from <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Queen Elizabeth</a> II's jewelry collection. Another change will see four of the crown's eight detachable arches removed to create "a different impression to when the Crown was worn by Queen Mary at the 1911 Coronation," the palace said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It was previously speculated that Camilla might wear the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>controversial crown</a> the Queen Mother wore to her husband King George's coronation in 1937. The headpiece features the divisive <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Koh-i-NÃ»r diamond</a>, a massive gem imported to Britain by the East India Company. It became part of Queen Victoria's collection but has been subject to ownership claims in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The St. Edward's Crown has also inspired a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>new emoji</a> that will appear on Twitter when any of the following hashtags are used: #Coronation, #CoronationConcert, #CoronationWeekend, #CoronationBigLunch and #TheBigHelpOut.
