Crews asks. "I’m listening, sir…"</p><p>He’s willing to give Hughley a chance to walk back his words, but Hughley isn’t interested.</p><p>Hughley replies: "You saw the video!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I have looked up to you my whole career as one of the funniest most talented people I’ve ever seen," Crews confesses.</p><p>"I remember when I saw you warming up the crowd at FRESH PRINCE OF BEL AIR," he recalls. "And I thought ‘this man is a genius.’"</p><p>"But now," Crews laments. "You are an example of when comedy turns to sarcasm and cynicism."</p><p>Crews accuses: "And you find it extremely easy to get jokes at someone else expense."</p><p>Unfortunately, there are a number of male comedians whom none of us view in the same way that we did many years ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"You mock my success, but all I ever did was support you," Crews says.</p><p>"You @50cent&nbsp;@unclerush and @tariqnasheed have decided my sexual assault was hilarious," he accuses.</p><p>In the summer of 2018, <a href=#>50 Cent said that Crews’ assault was his own fault</a>. A horrible thing to say to anyone, and also never true.</p><p>"Whereas," Crews points out. "There are a whole generation of black women and men who don’t think it’s funny."</p><p>"ABUSERS PROTECT ABUSERS but they MOCK SURVIVORS as well," Crews writes.</p><p>Notably, <a href=#>Russell Simmons on that list</a> has very famously and chillingly been accused of sexual assault.</p><p>"When you see me," Terry warns those who mock him. "Keep it moving."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Sir," Crews wrote in another tweet. "You said I should have pushed him back, or restrained him."</p><p>There are a lot of armchair quarterbacks when people share their stories of sexual assault. It’s a form of victim-blaming.</p><p>"And," Crews argues. "I DID ALL THOSE THINGS…"</p><p>"But you act like I didn’t," Crews accuses. "Were you there?"</p><p>Hughley fires back: "That’s different than slapping the s–t outa him."</p><p>Realistically, had Crews followed Hughley’s retroactive advice, he would have been carted out in handcuffs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Sexual assault and the rape culture that enables it persist, but there are two other factors in Terry Crews’ case.</p><p>The first is toxic masculinity, where many men seem to believe that they can solve their problems with violence.</p><p>There are embedded cultural notions that it’s natural for men to fight, and that there’s something wrong with a man who does not.</p><p>(Even when the violence could land the man in prison)</p><p>A number of black activists have pointed out that toxic masculinity can be even more of a problem for some black men.</p><p>That’s out of my lane, but worth mentioning in this very serious discussion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The other is racism and double-standards.</p><p>Let us imagine for a moment that Terry Crews had unleashed his physical might upon this man to defend himself.</p><p>He would have been arrested and very likely disgraced in the media.</p><p>In one move, he would have reinforced negative stereotypes of black men — being portrayed as violent and even as homophobic.</p><p>(Obviously, Terry Crews is neither)</p><p>That wouldn’t have done any good for him or for his family.</p><p>As it is, he’s facing enough terrible consequences simply for speaking out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Terry Crews dropped out of the The Expendables franchise due to pressure from the producer.</p><p>The Expendables is produced by Millennium Films, and it was producer Avi Lerner whom Crews says issued the threat.</p><p>It was an attempt to intimidate Crews into dropping his complaint.</p><p>Avi Lerner is, notably, the man who is producing the new Red Sonja film.</p><p>He has vocally defended Bryan Singer after yet another round of accusations that Singer is a sexual predator.</p><p>Avi is helping to blacklist one man who shared his #MeToo story, but happily employing a man accused of being a life-ruining monster.</p><p>That’s … quite a choice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It is worth mentioning that this stance from DL Hughley is unfortunately no surprise to many people.</p><p>As the conflict between Crews and Hughley took off on Twitter, many people brought up Hughley’s own past.</p><p>Hughley had an affair early in his career, and the affair resulted in a child.</p><p>Hughley spoke about how the child’s death — murdered at the hands of his mistress’ boyfriend — brought him closer to his wife.</p><p>That comment on his part has rubbed many people the wrong way, for obvious reasons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When it comes to the men who are victim-blaming Terry Crews, it’s a familiar story for others who have been groped or otherwise assaulted.</p><p>At the end of the day, victim-blaming is about trying to assure yourself that it would never happen to you.</p><p>Lots of people tell themselves that they would fight back.</p><p>Many men, particularly those who have been assaulted by women, know that they would be in prison.</p><p>Many women know that fighting back could make it worse or get them killed.</p><p>The only person who should be blamed for a sexual assault is the one doing it — and those who help them to get away with it.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>#MeToo: Stars Share Stories of Sexual Harassment, Assault</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper
