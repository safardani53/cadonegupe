I started full-time when I was about 15 or 16 but I just thought, I have achieved what I could at football.</p><p>“One day I thought maybe I could go into the scrap business and start at the bottom where my dad and uncle started.”</p><p>Alexander’s dad is <a href=#>tycoon Sandy Easdale</a>, who with his brother James, started in the family scrapyard business as boys, going there every night after school.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2021-greenock-morton-training-parklea-663120796.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/easdale-brothers-sandy-easdale-brother-826137665-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/easdale-brothers-sandy-easdale-brother-826137663.jpg><p>Today, in their fifties, the duo are worth £1.4billion after making their fortune in buses, taxis and window manufacturing.</p><p>Sandy says: “Scrap is in your blood, you either like it or hate it.”</p><p>He and James once travelled to London to buy a <a href=#>Bentley GT</a> first edition from Jack Barclay’s Mayfair showroom, which was in the middle of a renovation.</p><p>Sandy, 53, says: “There was a skip outside with some copper in it. I said to James, ‘There’s £30 worth of copper in there, put it in the boot.’</p><p>“To the amusement of Jack Barclay’s senior manager we put thirty quid of copper in a two hundred grand car.</p><p>“We will walk round<a href=#> London</a> and everybody is looking at the super cars but we’ll be looking at a skip!</p><p>“I’d rather have a skip lorry than a Ferrari – they’re the same price.”&nbsp;</p><h2>Hard graft</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/easdale-brothers-sandy-easdale-brother-826137759.jpg><p>Last October Alexander told his dad he was quitting Morton to become a scrap man working in the family junk yard in Greenock and Renfrew, near <a href=#>Glasgow</a>.</p><p>Sandy says: “It’s difficult to go from a Championship club to do a hard day’s graft.</p><p>“He left the football club on the Monday and started at the scrap yard the next day.</p><p>“At football you get your breakfast, then have a massage followed by a workout, then you get your dinner and watch a movie to recover.</p><p>It’s difficult to go from a Championship club to do a hard day’s graft</p><span class=quote-credit>Sandy Easdale</span><p>“Compare that to driving about collecting rubbish. I thought the experience would either make him or break him. But it has obviously made him.</p><p>“I told him, ‘Remember the future in football is an easy life compared to the scrapyard, you’re not going to sit in the boardroom,’ and he was fine with that.</p><p>“It’s dead easy to say wear a suit and sit in the boardroom and get 100 grand a year and a company car, but he didn’t want that.</p><p>“So he’s at the bottom rung of the whole empire.

He loves it. I am proud he has adapted so well.</p><p>“He doesn’t miss football at all and has not kicked a ball since.</p><p>“In the last ten years, I probably spoke to Alexander for five minutes a day. Conversation over and then he’d go to his room.</p><p>“Now he sits, has his dinner and we talk for ages. ‘I did this, I spoke to this person. How do you do this? How do you do that?’&nbsp;</p><p>Alexander doesn’t miss football at all and has not kicked a ball since</p><span class=quote-credit>Sandy Easdale</span><p>“He’s in the office dealing with customers and dealing with prices. He’s learned in the last nine months where to buy stuff, how much to sell for, what the profit margins are.</p><p>“He has the mental arithmetic that me and James have got.&nbsp;</p><p>“It surprises me how he’s adapted. He seems to have picked it up and run with it better than I’d ever have thought.”</p><p>Sandy says his son is also helping to modernise the operation, expanding into precious metals and trading in catalytic converters for cars.</p><p>“Talking of cars, I have the biggest car collection ever, so Alexander has access to Lamborghinis, Porches and Rolls-Royces,” Sandy says.</p><p>“But he’s happy driving a little white VW Caddy van that he goes to work in.</p><p>“He’s the most unbelievably down-to-earth boy you’d ever meet in your life.</p><p>“On the day he told me, ‘Dad, I’ve had enough,’ I said to him ‘You’re 22, I don’t want you telling me in five years’ time you finished my football career for me.’”</p><p>But Alexander has no regrets about turning his back on the world of football.</p><p>He says: “There was a lot more pressure in football than in my working life because you are being watched every Saturday.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“Here I’m just a worker, doing the job, 8-5, going out in the lorry picking up scrap, working the skips and the machinery in the yard.</p><p>“I feel a lot happier now and I am really enjoying it every day.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/easdale-brothers-sandy-easdale-brother-826137790.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/easdale-brothers-sandy-easdale-brother-826137760.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9zhJVxb21oX5u8sMDBmqOlnaJiwKS%2BwKlkspmimXqiuMSxmKeclad6pq3SnZilnV2osLDA06KqoWWTna6uvMiopaygmaV8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./katherine-waissbluth-lzst-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Katherine Waissbluth (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
