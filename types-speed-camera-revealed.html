href=#>gadgets</a> you might encounter on the roads and the <a href=#>laws</a> around them - here's everything you need to know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gdkykg-chesire-m6-motorway-vector-860978322.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Truvelo D-Cam</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ga043k-general-view-d-cam-860977240.jpg><p>D-Cams, short for digital cameras, arrived on UK roads in 2013.</p><p>They can be identified from their cylindrical shape and use <a href=#>infrared</a> lights to pick up traffic in the dark.</p><p>As a result, they do not flash and you may not notice being caught out by one.</p><p>They are usually found on central reservations and can monitor up to three lanes at once.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE MOTORS NEWS">READ MORE MOTORS NEWS</h2><p>As well as speeding, they can be combined with an array of sensors on the road to catch drivers jumping <a href=#>red lights</a>.</p><p>The cameras are able to store up to 10,000 images and even transmit them in real-time to <a href=#>police</a> databases.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Truvelo Combi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/akp2ae-truvelo-speed-camera-860976894.jpg><p>Made by the same company as the D-Cam, these are the older model that they replaced.</p><p>They are forward facing so can pick up the face of offending drivers at the wheel and, like the D-Cam, <a href=#>do not flash</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p>The Combi uses three marked lines on the road to calculate speed, while also relying on sensors at road-level.</p><p>They are more boxy than the D-Cam and are often accompanied by a separate camera with an orange lens to photograph those caught <a href=#>speeding</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>REDFLEX</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/460cafc3-19e3-4c2c-8e5b-f4eef46ff919.jpg><p>REDFLEX cameras are rarer on British roads but could become more common in the future after being granted <a href=#>Home Office</a> approval recently.</p><p>The company offers two different types of camera.</p><p>One monitors traffic lights, while the other can watch up to six lanes to detect speeding.</p><p>They are usually composed of a grey box with two supplemental cameras just below, one on each side.</p><p>They can capture high-resolution colour images and even catch multiple offences at the same time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Digital Gatso</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2182939635-860976652.jpg><p>The first speed camera used in the UK, having cropped up on the <a href=#>M40</a> as early as 1991, the Gatso is well-known to motorists.</p><p>They use radar tech and road markings to double-check speeds to catch speeders.</p><p>The only issue is that they are rear-facing, meaning they can't measure the speed of an approaching vehicle and can't pick up drivers' faces, only the rear plate.</p><p>This has led many offenders to claim they were not at the wheel at the time of the crime.</p><p>However, the window is closing on that excuse, as Gatsos are now being steadily replaced with more modern units.</p><p>It is true, though, that not all run-ins with Gatsos will actually result in a fine, with dummy units flashing drivers to warn them but not issuing a penalty.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>VECTOR-SR</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/abd29182-2a2a-4c71-a4bd-6d3f40aaefd8-1.jpg><p>From the original speed camera to the latest, the VECTOR-SR is sometimes known as the "<a href=#>Ultra Camera</a>".</p><p>They have been put up in the Greater <a href=#>Manchester</a> area and a more extensive rollout is expected in future.</p><p>The device does not rely on road markings, instead using a virtual grid system to determine speeds, eliminating the need for sensors.</p><p>Like the D-Cam, it does not flash and it is the first of its kind to be able to monitor traffic in both directions simultaneously.</p><p>The new camera also has in-built number plate recognition technology and, when it detects a speeding offence, it can also be used to check if you were <a href=#>wearing a seatbelt</a> or using your phone.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Handheld</h2><p>A bit of a technical downgrade from the ultra, but handheld speed guns have been relied on by police for years.</p><p>They are able to measure speed and identify vehicle make and model, as well as reading the plate at up to 820 yards.</p><p>The data can then be uploaded to police databases and have been approved to be used as evidence in <a href=#>court</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>SpeedCurb</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2a97wm4-close-up-speed-camera-860977247.jpg><p>This <a href=#>camera</a> is likely the one most Brits would recognise today.</p><p>Distinguished by its bright <a href=#>yellow</a>, boxy shell, it is sure to crop up in the nightmares of drivers up and down the country.</p><p>They often come in pairs, with one on each side of the road, allowing them to survey four lanes in both directions.</p><p>Like many other models, they make use of sensors and road markings to accurately measure speed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>VECTOR</h2><p>These differ from the SR version from the same brand as they are average speed cameras.</p><p>Instead of monitoring a particular point, sets of these devices are placed at either end of a longer stretch of road.</p><p>The first set captures drivers entering the zone and the time it takes to reach the second set is measured.</p><p>If your average speed over the distance is too high, you are given a ticket.</p><p>This prevents motorists from <a href=#>slowing down</a> just before a camera, only to speed off again 100 yards later.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>SpeedSpike</h2><p>Another average <a href=#>speed camera</a>, these are the new kid on the block and the manufacturer claims to be able to link a set of over 1,000 to monitor an area 24 hours a day.</p><p>They can also be positioned in the centre or off to the side of roads, making it <a href=#>harder to predict where they might be</a>.</p><p>As with the VECTOR and other average speed checks, they can use number plate recognition to identify your vehicle in the event that you're caught out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mobile cameras</h2><p>Mobile <a href=#>cameras</a> are used in roaming enforcement vans that can spot dangerous drivers on the move.</p><p>The van carries an operator equipped with a camera like a mini Gatso or speed gun to conduct spot checks of the roads.</p><p>In effect, this means that any stretch of road could be monitored even if no cameras are installed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lone Ranger</h2><p>This is a form of mobile camera that has gained popularity since 2018.</p><p>The operator holds a long-range lens which can spot speeding within half a mile and detect mobile phone offences.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Traffic light</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cfc3dd95-b371-424e-9327-2f32294652d6.jpg><p>These have become rarer since other cameras developed the capacity for <a href=#>red light</a> enforcement, but traffic light cameras can still catch you speeding.</p><p>They also don't have to be painted yellow as dedicated speed cameras do under a 2001 law so can be hard to spot.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>DS2</h2><p>DS2s are a little unusual in the sense that they are only semi-permanent.</p><p>They make use of "piezo strips", which are embedded into the road.</p><p>The cameras are then driven along in a van and connected up to the strips, which monitor speed.</p><p>This effectively turns the van into a temporary camera site, which can then be moved on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Siemens SafeZone</h2><p>These are some of the hardest devices to sport owing to their small size.</p><p>They look more like the average <a href=#>CCTV</a> camera but are often put to work in low-speed zones, such as near <a href=#>schools</a>.</p><p>They can also be fitted to existing infrastructure, so it's not always obvious that they have been specially installed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>PEEK</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2jbdtc5-goole-hensall-level-crossing-860978039.jpg><p>Like Gatsos, Peek cameras are a bit out of date and only a small handful remain active in the UK.</p><p>They are rear-facing and use radar technology but are slowly being supplanted by more advanced optioned.</p><p>Drivers can identify them by their shape, with a large yellow box sporting two lenses on the front.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>HADECS3</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2a6tj2f-new-sensitive-speed-cameras-860978329.jpg><p>These cameras are closely associated with the controversial <a href=#>smart motorway</a> project, being used on roads like the M5, M1, M25 and M4.</p><p>They are usually placed on overhead gantries and look like a narrow rectangular box.</p><p>The HADECS, which stands for Highway Agency Digital Enforcement Camera System, can monitor up to five lanes, including the <a href=#>hard shoulder</a>, and operate in all <a href=#>weather</a> conditions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>SPECS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2015-three-specs-average-speed-860978323.jpg><p>Introduced in 1999, these are another average speed camera.</p><p>They operate in pairs and it is impossible to tell which two are linked.</p><p>Nonetheless, they can monitor up to 12.4 miles of carriageway and can detect if you have changed lanes to try and get out of a ticket.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Aecom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2a3c18b5-6409-4902-a7d2-f329fee74363-1.jpg><p>These are the most recent form of mobile speed camera, using <a href=#>AI</a> to "<a href=#>spy inside your car</a>" and detect seatbelt or mobile phone offences.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>They are transported on hi-tech vans and can record HD images of vehicles, making identifying drivers easier than ever.</p><p>In a three-day trial in <a href=#>Cornwall</a>, similar devices saw over <a href=#>300 motorists issued with fines</a>.</p><p class=postsid
