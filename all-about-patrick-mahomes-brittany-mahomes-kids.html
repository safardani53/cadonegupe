Their son, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Patrick "Bronze" Lavon Mahomes III</a>, arrived on Nov. 28, 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In October 2022, Patrick opened up about being a father during an episode of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Football in America</a>. The athlete said he plans to "stay out of the way" when it comes to his kids' potential athletic interests.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think that's the best thing for me," he explained. "I'm going to help teach my son, my daughter all the fundamentals and whatever they want to learn. But at the same time, I want to let it be about them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Patrick continued: "That's what my dad did growing up, that's what my parents did.

I think that's why I'm in the position I am today."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Sean M.

Brittany and Sterling ‚Äî <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>wearing a tiny leather jacket</a> with "Mahomes" and his number "15" on the back ‚Äî joined Patrick on the field after his victory.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In November 2023, the entire family starred in a holiday campaign for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kim Kardashian</a>'s clothing brand, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>SKIMS</a>.

Later that month, they shared the news that they were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>expecting baby number one</a>. "Just taking a small detour to the weddingüò¨‚ù§Ô∏è," Brittany wrote beside a photo of the couple <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>holding a sonogram</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>welcomed their daughter</a> on Feb. 20, 2021, in Kansas City, Missouri. The announcement included a photo of baby Sterling holding Patrick's finger with the message, "Sterling Skye Mahomes üë∏üèº 2/20/21 6lbs 11oz."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Days later, Brittany revealed that they planned to hold off on sharing photos of Sterling's face until they "felt the time was right." That time came four months later, in June 2021, when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sterling</a> officially made her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Instagram debut</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Obviously at first we wanted to keep stuff private and not have her out there," Patrick told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>TODAY</a> in July 2021. "It almost became like a burden to try to hide her at all times when we do stuff, and this coming season we want her to be at the games and not have to worry about hiding her the entire time. We just want to give her the most normal life that she possibly can so she can grow and have friends and learn and get better and better every single day."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">2021 and 2022 were marked by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>firsts</a> for the new family of three: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Sterling's first Christmas</a>, her first New Year's, her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>first birthday</a>, her first <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Father's Day</a>, her first time on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>football field</a> and her first <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=6>commercial</a>. Sterling appeared in an Oakley ad alongside her dad, and he couldn't have been prouder. "We got a special day. We got Ster-Ster's first commercial," Patrick said at the time. "She's going to be the real star of the family."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Brittany Mahomes Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, perhaps the most special moment for the family came on March 12, 2022, when Patrick and Brittany got married. In July 2021, Patrick told PEOPLE he was hoping to have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sterling be the flower girl</a> at their wedding, and in 2022, Brittany confirmed that was the case. "Having your daughter apart of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>your wedding</a>, just hits differentü•∫üíï," Brittany wrote on Instagram. Sterling scooted down the aisle in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>tiny blue car</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Patrick is extremely excited to watch his little girl grow up, and he's looking forward to all of the new challenges that may bring. When asked if he would be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>willing to do Sterling's hair</a> when she gets older, Patrick told PEOPLE, "I will try my best. I've tried to work with Brittany's hair before and I'm not the best at it, but I'll definitely do whatever I can as a dad ‚Äî and as a girl dad ‚Äî to learn how to do at least a couple things so if I'm ever put in a position where I'm the one taking care of her hair, I know a couple of tricks."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sterling is already proving to be quite the fashionista ‚Äî in October 2022, Brittany shared a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sweet photo</a> of her daughter walking with a mini Louis Vuitton purse on her arm. In the snap, the little girl pairs her bag with a white t-shirt, black leggings and a pair of white sneakers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that month, Brittany <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shared a cute photo</a> on her Instagram Story of Sterling wearing football-print pajamas while playing with a toy stroller. The proud mom wrote that her daughter was "just waiting on her baby brother to be here to match with her."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sterling was again seen in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>football-themed ensemble</a> when, a week later, she and her mom attended the Kansas City Chiefs away game in San Francisco. Brittany shared photos from their day on Instagram, showing off their mother-daughter matching outfits, which featured red pants and black shirts featuring "Mahomes" printed in white. Sterling was also seen in her "15" jean jacket, which she debuted earlier in the season. "Game Days with my girl‚ù§Ô∏èüíõ #chiefskingdom," Brittany wrote in the caption.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A week after Brittany and Patrick welcomed their son, Bronze, the personal trainer posted photos of Sterling on Instagram ‚Äî and shared that her little girl has been "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>doing so good as a big sister</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brittany added: "She loves her brother so much & has been just the best little helper!! I felt like so many people were trying to put this negative idea of how much she was gonna hate not being the only child into my head & it was kind of starting to upset me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Jan. 15, 2023, Brittany shared <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>adorable videos</a> on her Instagram Story of Sterling taking care of her baby doll. In one clip, the toddler cradled the doll and sang to it. "Rocking and singing to her baby," Brittany wrote. In a second video, Sterling put her doll in a toy crib then climbed into the crib herself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that month, Brittany shared pictures of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sterling copying Patrick in the gym</a>. In one photo, the toddler held tiny hot pink weights while her dad worked out in the background.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If it's one thing she loves to do, it's watch her daddy," the proud mom wrote on the photo, posted on Jan. 25, 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Feb. 19, 2023, the Mahomes family celebrated Sterling's second birthday with a candy-themed bash. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>"Sterling's Two Sweet" party</a> offered a lot of fun and games for the birthday girl and her friends, including a ball pit and a bounce house.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My baby girl is a whole 2 years old! ü•π I can't even believe it.

The couple shared a sweet photo of their newborn's feet as he slept on a fleece blanket emblazoned with the name "Mahomes." Also pictured was a custom chain with Bronze's name spelled out in diamonds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Patrick and Brittany first revealed their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>family was growing</a> on May 29, 2022. "Round 2!" the duo captioned a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>trio of pictures</a> featuring them and Sterling holding an ultrasound and a sign that says "Big sister duties ‚Ä¶ coming <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>soon</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brittany later revealed that their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>second child wasn't "planned"</a> while answering questions for an Instagram Story Q&A. In the April 2023 post, the mom-of-two revealed he "happened on our wedding night ü§≠."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On June 26, 2022, the couple revealed the sex of their second child, telling PEOPLE they were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>preparing to welcome a baby boy</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Brittany Mahomes Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the couple have shared plenty of sweet moments of their children online, Brittany let fans know that parenting two young kids <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>isn't always easy</a>. "Today is my first day of chaos since having 2 kidsü§£ü§Ø," she wrote in a Dec. 14, 2022, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Twitter</a> post.

The newborn accompanied his mom and sister in Glendale, Arizona, for the 2023 Super Bowl, where Brittany <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>posted a series of sweet photos of her kids</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Just the best little guy üòä," she captioned on snap of her and Bronze wearing matching neutral outfits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Patrick and Brittany initially abstained from showing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bronze's face on social media</a>, they finally shared a full image of the boy in a family photo from Disneyland after Patrick's Super Bowl win. The joint post featured a photo of the group posing in front of Sleeping Beauty's Castle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Welcome to the happiest place on earth, Bronze and Sterling! ‚ù§Ô∏è," the pair wrote in the caption.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Brittany Mahomes Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Feb. 28, 2023, Brittany shared photos on her Instagram Story to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrate Bronze turning 3 months old</a>.
