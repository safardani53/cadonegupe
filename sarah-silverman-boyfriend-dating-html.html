But&nbsp;the comedian, Sarah Silverman, who has dated the likes of Jimmy Kimmel and Michael Sheen, found romance mid-pandemic through the video game. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Silverman Met Her Boyfriend Via Call Of Duty</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>With many people exploring their hobbies during this pandemic, for the Ralph Breaks the Internet star, it was all about expanding and diving into her video game catalog.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in October 2020, Silverman was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hosted</a> on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. There, she confessed that as the world was shutting down everywhere,&nbsp;she decided her time would be better spent playing video games again. It just seemed the right thing to do. She went to GameStop and bought a console and a couple of games, out of which she really got into Call of Duty: WWII. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the show, she also revealed that she was, in fact, engaged in a new romantic avenue with a certain someone. That someone, however, was not revealed then itself. But she went over how they found love in their mutual love for video games.&nbsp;</p><p>When Silverman posted about her love for the game online, she said that a man slid into her DMs and invited her to play. She knew this man as he was one of her contemporaries in the comedy entertainment business. At this moment in time, they had not met each other, but after clapping for the heroes at 7, they clapped some Nazi heads together.&nbsp;</p><p>We would bang the pots and pans out on the fire escape. It really became just like a group primal scream. It was actually kind of beautiful to be in New York at that time. Then at 7:05, I'd put my headset on and I'd kill Nazis with this guy</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>And to perhaps as much a surprise to herself as to others, they were dating just like that! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The mystery man soon enough relocated to quarantine with the comedian in New York, and that is where we are today as a tight and madly-in-love couple. We now know the man as the talented comedian Rory Albanese, who was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> in November 2020 on a&nbsp;podcast. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On February 10, 2021, Silverman took it upon Instagram to post a cute<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> picture</a> of themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>In the picture, Albanese is carrying Silverman with his back turned to the camera. She captioned the photo with a verse from the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">poem</a> Footprints in the Sand — "It was then that I carried you." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>The Comedian Duo Laughing Their Way Through Love</h2><p>Rory Albanese is a man of laughs himself. Apart from being an avid fan of the Call of Duty games, he is a stand-up comedian, a showrunner, and was an executive producer for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Prior to meeting Sarah, he had been in a long-term relationship with Reagan Baker, which crumbled in 2018.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Silverman’s Past Affairs Have Been With Funny Men</h2><p>After being together for close to four years, Silverman called it quits with the actor Michael Sheen in 2017. Regarding the breakup, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">commented </a>that since she had been single and independent for so long, she enjoyed being that way. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Even when they were dating, she would often send Sheen away in the night because she valued her quality time by herself. Sheen, on the other hand, was completely okay with it.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, she stated she had&nbsp;remained friendly with Sheen when she appeared as a guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, another funny man she had dated.&nbsp;</p><p>Silverman and Kimmel <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dated</a> for seven years, starting in 2002, and they were a high-profile item in the entertainment industry. They were pretty much on and off during their time but never got to the point of calling each other husband and wife. And again, they have continued to stay on good terms after the fallout.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlno5a%2ForSMrKClrpWnuqK6jJumsp6inrKvsIydmK2hnpx7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hooded-sherpa-blanket-18-off-black-friday.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Save 18 off this Hooded sherpa blanket ahead of Black Friday">&larr;
