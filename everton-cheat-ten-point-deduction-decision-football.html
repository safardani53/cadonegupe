As much as some would claim otherwise, Everton have not been found guilty of cheating.</p><p><a href=#>That jaw-dropping ten-point deduction</a> is not a result of trying to defraud rivals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pictured-second-goal-game-premier-849004669-3.jpg><p>Not from welching on transfer deals. Not from defaulting on payments.</p><p>It is down to overspending. It is because <a href=#>they have been foolish with their money.</a></p><p>It is because they have <a href=#>run up bigger debts than their income allows.</a></p><p>And it is because <span id=74058f73-7143-4304-97cf-bb2ec187a21a class=suggested-link>football</span> is now run by independent panels and accountants.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE IN FOOTBALL">READ MORE IN FOOTBALL</h2><p>A sport where red tape, not refs, now calls the shots. One of back-door <span id=f0f23dec-0fd3-48ef-b3be-a00f0484413f class=suggested-link>politics</span>.</p><p>Of course Friday’s ruling was a terrible day for <a href=#>Everton</a>. But it goes far deeper than that.</p><p>It was a terrible day for the game as a whole.</p><p>One when the entire landscape changed irrevocably. A reason why it has become far easier to hate football than love it.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p><strong><a aria-label="FREE BETS - BEST BETTING OFFERS AND BONUSES NEW CUSTOMERS (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS - BEST BETTING OFFERS AND BONUSES NEW CUSTOMERS</a></strong></p><p>Because anyone who thinks this is a one-off, the sign that it will bring others to their senses and drag everyone into line, is living in another world.</p><p>This is only the start, believe me.</p><p>The <span id=1f31fcbc-1519-487b-857a-94c24ad74040 class=suggested-link>swinging</span> open of the door to a world where Premier League clubs are already running to teacher and snitching on rivals, <a href=#>like Chelsea and Manchester City for example.</a></p><p>And a sport where the winners will ultimately be those who can afford the best lawyers and fight the most stringent and strongest defence.</p><p>Something this column warned about in Everton’s case, incidentally, when Denise Barrett-Baxendale, Grant Ingles and Graeme Sharp were drummed out in June.</p><p>CEO Barrett-Baxendale and chief finance and strategy officer Ingles were the two fighting the case. The only two in Goodison with the inside knowledge and expertise.</p><p>When they left, there was no one with details of all the facts and figures — and know-how — to pick up the baton.</p><p>Had they stayed, the outcome could well have been the same.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'They haven’t cheated'</h2><p>But at least they’d have been better placed to fight their corner — then and now, with the appeal.</p><p>There is no doubt Everton are a club that have been run abysmally. <span id=ac53bd6c-ad0c-474e-9416-6620e30c9004 class=suggested-link>Farhad Moshiri</span> can rightfully be accused of that. No one could possibly argue otherwise.</p><p>Signings such as <span id=8d4c7d68-c08c-46de-a348-211617df7c61 class=suggested-link>Andre Gomes</span>, <a href=#>Alex Iwobi</a>, <span id=d3d74185-8556-496d-827d-0f81dca4659c class=suggested-link>Moise Kean</span>...the list of big-money flops is endless. But they haven’t cheated.</p><p>What they have done is over-spent, as simple as that.</p><p>Well, either they’ve got no mirrors in the Premier League or those rivals who initially complained studiously avoid them.</p><p>But what this ruling means is that effectively we now no longer know what we are watching or what the final table will be.</p><p>No one going to a game will be able to say with certainty what that day’s result actually means.</p><p>A 2-1 win? Where are we in the table now, then? Only there won’t be a definite answer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'This is a whole new ball game'</h2><p>It could be sixth but, then again, it might be third. Or perhaps as low as 15th.</p><p>Football has steadily been edging away from the sport we all fell in love with as kids.</p><p>One where it was all about the goals, the tackles, the saves, the matches. Those days are long gone.</p><p>Yes, there have been points deductions in the Premier League before, but not in these circumstances.</p><p><a href=#>Portsmouth</a> were docked nine in 2010 for going into administration.</p><p>In 1997 <span id=ec250010-5211-462d-a89d-f48b35f87475 class=suggested-link>Middlesbrough</span> lost three for postponing a game against Premier League orders amid an injury crisis.</p><p>But this is a whole new ball game. One decided by independent panels imposing rules that no one fully understands.</p><p>Until the appeal is heard, there remains hope for Everton. Yet it doesn’t alter the fact that accountants have taken over.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>How long before it’s not about the top goalscorer but the top lawyer?</p><p>Something all those rivals currently sniggering behind their hands would do well to bear in mind.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH91g5draHJoX5rDpr7TqKVmm5iarrV5056lZqifnru1ecOem66bpJ68r3nDnpqiq5mku26yzqirm5mcoXw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./prince-charles-camilla-return-sandringham-flower-show-first-time-since-2019.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Prince Charles and Camilla Visit Sandringham Flower Show for First Time Since 2019">&larr;
