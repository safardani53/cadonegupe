Richie was 24-year-old at the time of his death.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Blake Shelton Opened up Regarding Ritchie's Death</h2><p>Talking with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cowboys and Indians</a> in 2018, Shelton opened up about the death of his brother. Shelton accepted he would never get over the death of his beloved brother.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The country music icon said his brother, Ritchie, was&nbsp;someone he looked up to. Per Shelton, he always wished to be like his brother. He further said,</p><p>&nbsp;I wanted to be him. I wanted to look like him, dress like him, listen to what he listened to and be into the things he was into.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Shelton recalled when his world "literally went silent" after knowing about the tragic passing of his brother and his family.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He explained how Ritchie's death left a void in his world all of a sudden and confessed that he's still not over it, instead told how the acclaimed singer was just used to it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The lyrics of his former wife Miranda Lambert's famous song 'Over You,' which Shelton co-wrote, reflect how much the country singer misses his long-gone brother. A piece of lyrics reads,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>How dare you, I miss you<br>They say I’ll be OK<br>But I’m not going to ever get over you</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Blake Shelton's Siblings</h2><p>Shelton had two siblings, but after the demise of Ritchie currently, The 'Nobody But You' hitmaker has a sister named Endy Shelton as his only sibling. She is popularly known as the sister of Shelton, the reputed&nbsp;singer, and television personality.&nbsp;The brother and sister are understood to be close to each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier in 2020, on Siblings' day, Shelton's sister Endy posted an old picture of the siblings and paid tribute to her late brother Ritchie. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Endy was born on March 7, 1972, in Oklahoma and is currently married. Sibling Endy keeps her private life under the wraps, so much so that her family life with her husband and kids is relatively unknown.&nbsp;</p><p>The only known details of Endy's family is that she is married to someone named Mike and is the mother of two kids, a daughter and a son.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Blake Shelton's Closely Knit Family</h2><p>As quoted by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CountryFanCast.com</a>, having a close-knit extended family has helped Shelton cope with his big brother's passing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the past, Shelton mentioned his "huge family" had always come together, and he could always count on them.</p><p>He remembers when they celebrated an enormous "Thanksgiving" and a "gigantic" <a href=# rel=follow>Christmas</a> and called her late grandmother the glue that kept the family together.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>But unfortunately, after the passing of his grandmother, the extended family members do not see each other as often as they once used to.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqclrimedKhnKWsn6N6tLXBpaCnn6NjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./paris-hilton-on-instagram-check-out-my-boobs-again.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Check Out My Boobs Again!">&larr;
