Can they change over time?</h2><p>Your breast size will change with time, most people aren't the same size now as there were when they first started puberty.</p><p>Experts at <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Hopkins Medicine</a> explained that when the ovaries start to produce and release estrogen, fat in the connective tissue starts to collect.</p><p>"This causes the breasts to enlarge.</p><p>"The duct system also starts to grow. Often these breast changes happen at the same that pubic hair and armpit hair appear," medics explained.</p><p>When it comes to size it's all about hormones and experts say that touching or massaging them won't help them grow bigger.</p><h2>2. Is the size linked to cancer?</h2><p><a href=#>Breast cancer</a> is the most common cancer in the UK and the most prevalent in women.</p><p>Experts at <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Cancer Research UK</a> say that breast cancer risk is higher in women with the most dense breast tissue compared to less dense tissue.</p><p>"Women with dense breast tissue have less fat and more breast cells and connective tissue in their breasts", they explained.</p><h2>3. What conditions are associated with large breasts?</h2><p>Many people want to have larger breasts, but for some that do, they can cause a myriad of <a href=#>health issues</a>.</p><p>The most common condition associated with a bigger bust is back pain - as the weight of the boobs can put pressure on the back.</p><p>Some people also struggle to<a href=#> exercise</a> if they have a bigger chest as the additional weight can be hard to manage.</p><p>One woman previously told how her breasts were so large that she <a href=#>struggled to walk</a>.</p><p>Another woman said she felt as though she would be left <a href=#>permanently disabled</a> by the crushing weight of her K cup breasts.</p><h2>4. How can I change the size?</h2><p>If you want to change the size of your breasts then you could get an enlargement which is classed as a cosmetic procedure and would not be done on the <a href=#>NHS.</a></p><p>If you feel your breasts are too big and you want a reduction, there are some instances as to when the NHS would carry out this operation.</p><p>This includes severe <a href=#>backache</a>, shoulder or neck pain, skin irritation, rashes and skin infections under the breasts and grooves on the shoulders from bra straps.</p><p>You might also be considered if you are suffering from psychological distress such as low self-esteem or <a href=#>depression</a> or you struggle to take part in sport.</p><h2>5. Why does weight play a role?</h2><p><a href=#>Weight</a> plays a role in breast size.</p><p>This is because fat plays a big part in breast tissue and the density of your breasts.</p><h2>6. Will they change if I exercise?</h2><p>If you lose weight, you might also lose weight from your breasts, meaning you have to get a smaller sized bra.</p><p>Some exercises can also change the appearance of your breasts such as pectoral exercises such as push-ups and bench presses.</p><p>While they won't necessarily change the size of your boobs, these exercises can make them look perkier.</p><h2>7. Does my period make a difference?</h2><p>When you're on your <a href=#>period</a> you might experience swollen and tender breasts.</p><p>This is because your hormones change during your cycle, causing the breast ducts to grow in size.</p><h2>8. Will they change if I give birth?</h2><p>Around three to five days after giving birth breasts become larger.</p><p>This is down to lymphatic fluid building up in the vessels of the breasts.</p><p>At this point milk is being actively produced and filling the ducts.</p><p>It's likely that after giving birth your breasts - especially your nipples, will become extremely sensitive.</p><h2>9. How should I check my breasts?</h2><p>There are five things every woman needs to know when it comes to <a href=#>checking your boobs</a> for signs of cancer.</p><h4>Step one</h4><p>Begin by looking in a mirror, facing it with your arms on your hips and your shoulders straight.</p><p>You should be looking for any dimpling, puckering, bulging skin, redness, soreness, a rash or changes in the nipple.</p><h4>Step two</h4><p>Still looking in the mirror, raise both arms above your head and check for the same changes.</p><h4>Step three</h4><p>With your arms still above your head, check for any fluid coming from the nipples.</p><p>This can include milky, yellow or watery fluid, or blood.</p><h4>Step four</h4><p>While lying down use your opposite hand to check each breast. Using a few fingers, keeping them flat and together, go in a small circular motion around your breasts.</p><p>Make sure you feel the entire breast by going top to bottom in these small circles.</p><p>It helps to develop a system or pattern to make sure every inch is covered.</p><p>Use light pressure for the skin and tissue just beneath, medium pressure for the tissue in the middle of your breasts, and firm pressure to feel the tissue at the back, feeling down to your ribcage.</p><h4>Step five</h4><p>Feel your breasts while either standing or sitting, using the same small circular motions.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>If you spot any unusual changes in your breasts then it's important that you visit your GP.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Breast tissue reaches all the way up to your collarbone and across to your armpit, so it’s vital to check these areas too.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxyhJhuanBqY2Sut7HRmp6eZZKnsqK%2F02aqorKVYsKsecGopptllpawtb%2BMp5yenF2gu7DDjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./amy-lynn-preasmyer-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where Is Amy Lynn Preasmyer Now?
