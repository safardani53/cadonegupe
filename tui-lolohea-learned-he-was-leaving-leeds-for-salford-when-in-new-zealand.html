What are we going to do?’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AM30125.jpg><p>“Watto said he’d seen something in me, that he could help me and get me back to where I should be playing.</p><p>“He showed a lot of confidence in me and backed me. It was difficult at Leeds as I was playing full-back and half-back but he just said, ‘Come here and you’ll play at half-back.’</p><p>“It was good to go into a team and just focus on my job.”</p><p>Lolohea is used to upsetting the odds after almost inspiring Tonga to the World Cup final in 2017.</p><p>After beating his native New Zealand, they came within an inch of beating England in the semi-finals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/RLlolohea16-6-1.jpg><p>That did not stop him being feted on the Pacific island his father Paul hails from - for he was given land in the village of Lapaha by the king!</p><p>“It’s pretty special to receive a gift from the king,” Lolohea added. “And tomorrow is a big day for Tonga and I have a lot of family there. My dad’s sisters live there and I’ve cousins there.</p><p>“But the whole village turned out for the land giving ceremony, which was attended by the Prince. However, I haven’t seen the land, I just know there’s something there for me.</p><p>“And living in Tonga is like living in another world. You live off the land and money is nothing there.”</p><p>Lolohea is key to Salford's hopes of a first Challenge Cup win since 1938 on their first Wembley appearance since 1969.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/RLlolohea16-3-1.jpg><p>But this will be a battle born 10,000 miles away as fellow Tongan Konrad Hurrell faces him - and whatever happens there will be laughter.</p><p>“Konrad is just a funny guy,” Lolohea told SunSport. “Follow him on social media and for the last couple of months he’s been posting all kinds of stuff.</p><p>“I’ve played alongside him for most of my career but I try and give it to him in the games, even though he’s a bloody wrecking ball.</p><p>“And getting to Wembley is just crazy. I’ve seen comments from Salford diehards like, ‘I’ve been waiting so long for this day.’ They can’t be part of it either. I feel bad for them but it makes it more special.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">THE LATEST IN RUGBY LEAGUE</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH5zhZNsbnFrX6nCqnnLqKOooJWWeq2xwKulnpxdnbJuw8CsZKWdkau2r7OMpZyenKNis7C%2BjKyYpZ6fp7Fuw8eepWahnmK7psOMs5yapJGjsXA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-lindsey-morgan-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Lindsey Morgan Dating Now">&larr;
