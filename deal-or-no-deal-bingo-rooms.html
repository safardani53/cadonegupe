While it might not be on TV screens, you can still get your DOND fix on Sun Bingo.</p><p>Over the 11 years that Deal or No Deal was active, 2975 shows aired.</p><p>Originally, players could win between 1p and £250,000, based on what amounts were in the boxes selected from the 22 boxes in play.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/RR-OFFPLEX-bingo-deal-nodeal.jpg><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# aria-label="JOIN SUN BINGO NOW AND YOU'LL GET A £50 BINGO BONUS AND 50 FREE SPINS (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">JOIN SUN BINGO NOW AND YOU'LL GET A £50 BINGO BONUS AND 50 FREE SPINS</a>*</strong></p><p>The first winner of the 1p prize was Nick Bain in 2006.</p><p>It wasn’t until 2007 that the first £250,000 prize was won, by Laura Pearce.</p><p>The game format changed in 2014 when Box 23 was introduced.</p><p>This new box was offered at the end of the game. The host at the helm, Noel Edmunds, asked the contestant whether they wanted to buy the special blue (rather than iconic red) box for the amount they had already won on the show.</p><p>Box 23 contained one of five labels:</p><ul><li>Double – This doubled the amount that the contestant would win, changing the potential winning pot to between 2p and £500,000.</li><li>+10,000 – This added £10,000 to the winning amount, allowing contestants to win between £10,000.01 and £260,000.</li><li>Money Back – The contestant was refunded the amount they paid for the box.</li><li>Half – The contestant was awarded half the amount they had secured during the game – making it possible to win between 0.5p and £125,000.</li><li>Nothing – The harshest possible outcome. The contestant would leave with nothing. Not even a chance to join the infamous 1p Club.</li></ul><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=#>HERE'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT BINGO BONUSES WITH SUN BINGO</a></strong></p><p>In the same year, the game introduced the Offer Button.</p><p>This option was available to contestants who correctly guessed the Banker’s opening offer within 10% of the actual offer.</p><p>The button could be pressed any time after the first five boxes had been opened. It meant the Banker had to make an instant offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>By the time the show stopped airing, 52 people had joined the 1p Club, and 9 lucky winners had scooped the £250,000!</p><p>With the exciting news that ITV have confirmed a new series of Deal or No Deal with Stephen Mulhern as the presenter, it might be time to brush up on your DOND skills.</p><p>Sun Bingo has two DOND-themed rooms. Which will you play in?</p><h3><strong>Deal or No Deal 75</strong></h3><p>Deal or No Deal 75, unsurprisingly, hosts 75-ball bingo games.</p><p>You can try your luck at beating the banker at any time of day, as this is a 24-hour room.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=#>PLAY THE MEGA SPIN-GO WHEEL FOR THE CHANCE TO WIN BIG PRIZES DAILY</a></strong></p><p>Tickets cost between 5p and 25p, depending which particular game you’re playing in.</p><p>The full house prize starts at £50 and can rise to £125!</p><p>With over 700 daily chances to win, there’s Noel way you’ll want you miss out on playing in this room.</p><p>Each game has prizes for 1L, 2L, 3L, 4L and full house. Most games also accept Free Tickets.</p><p>Of course, that’s not all! It wouldn’t be a Deal or No Deal room without a call from the Banker…</p><p>The full house winner will receive an offer from the Banker, based on what amount could be in the box allocated to the contestant at the start of the game.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=#>THE HIDDEN GEMS OF THE OASIS ROOM AND BRITISH COASTLINE</a></strong></p><p>All of the other players can see the offer and get a chance to vote on whether they think the winner should take the deal.</p><p>The winner can see the outcome of this vote, but ultimately the choice is up to them!</p><p>Would you take the deal?</p><h3><strong>Deal or No Deal</strong></h3><p>This room runs games in largely the same way as Deal or No Deal 75.</p><p>However, this room hosts 90-ball games. Most of the games take Free Tickets, with some also activating the 1TG and 2TG feature as well.</p><p>This means that prizes are also won by those who have either one or two numbers left on their tickets when the full house is called.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=#>CHECK OUT THESE FEEL GOOD FRIDAY STRETCHES</a></strong></p><p>Both Deal or No Deal 75 and the 90-ball room have exclusive, community, progressive jackpots.</p><p>The DOND 75 jackpot starts at £5,000 and is currently worth over £20,500. It’s triggered by the jackpot being called in 43 calls or less.</p><p>The DOND jackpot also starts at £5,000, with the current pot worth over £20,800.</p><p>It must be triggered within 34 calls of less.</p><p>As these are community pots, both jackpots are split 50:50 between the full house winner(s) and the other players with valid tickets for the winning game.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# aria-label="PLAY IN OUR DEAL OR NO DEAL BINGO ROOMS BY SIGNING UP TO SUN BINGO (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">PLAY IN OUR DEAL OR NO DEAL BINGO ROOMS BY SIGNING UP TO SUN BINGO</a></strong></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bingo</h2></p><p>*New customers only.
