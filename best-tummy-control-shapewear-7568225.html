While it has a reputation of cinching and sculpting, shapewear does not have to feel uncomfortable, especially when wearing the compressive undergarment to target more sensitive areas such as the stomach. Instead, tummy control options should feel comfortable and supportive while delivering all of the amazing benefits of shapewear.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With targeted compression in the midsection, tummy control shapewear is designed to help shape, smooth, and enhance the stomach area. “People might want to purchase this type of shapewear to achieve a streamlined, flat look under fitted clothing or to boost their confidence in tighter, body-hugging outfits,” Susie Taaffe, the founder of Skanties Anti-Shapewear, tells PEOPLE.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From celebrities such as Kim Kardashian (and her amazing Skims shapewear line) to fashion moguls like Gigi Hadid, tummy control shapewear is a fun and functional tool to add to your wardrobe for special events and everyday wear. We scoured the internet for the best tummy control shapewear, carefully looking at various styles (including underwear and bike shorts), fabric flexibility, and more to determine which shapewear is actually worth buying.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to discover more about the best tummy-control shapewear of 2024.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-everyday-skims-core-control-high-waisted-thong></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Everyday</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Core Control High-Waisted Thong</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Skims Core Control High-Waisted Thong" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ylRznY3rc3LRntfH-uAVaECpAeI=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Skims-Core-Control-High-Waisted-Thong-5a71f3df82864a84a26ba44c68f79db2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our top pick for the best tummy control shapewear is the Core Control High-Waisted Thong from Skims. Constructed from a stretchy yet compressive nylon material, this high-waisted thong form fits the body and provides lots of support to the low belly and waist without it feeling too tight and uncomfortable. It’s our top pick for everyday because it’s both shapewear and underwear, and in addition to smoothing the core, it also moonlights as a waist-cincher, thanks to its high-rise design.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The undergarment also comes in many colors, including nine different skin tones and classic black, so you can choose one that matches your skin and doesn’t show through thin materials. It also features a comfortable silicone band at the top to hold it in place against your skin and prevent it from rolling down or shifting out of place. On top of that, it has an excellent size range featuring 2XS through 4XL and costs under $35 for such a high-quality and versatile piece.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>79% nylon. 21% spandex | <strong>Sizes: </strong>XXS-4XL | <strong>Style: </strong>Thong underwear | <strong>Colors: </strong>Onyx, espresso, cocoa, jasper, bronze, sienna, ochre, clay, mica, sand</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-jockey-slimmers-breathe-high-rise-brief></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jockey Slimmers Breathe High-Rise Brief</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jockey Slimmers Breathe High-Rise Brief" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/GbOOSBgggH4q3IeuzpMsSfy9oVE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jockey-Slimmers-Breathe-High-Rise-Brief-6ec9a8bd26324c829a7ab1b976da63bf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jockey</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a pair of shapewear undies with a more budget-friendly price tag, consider the Jockey Slimmers Breathe High-Rise Brief, which costs $26 (or you can get two for $34) and features a high-quality construction despite the low cost.

Because it has such strong compression and covers the torso area, the bodysuit doubles as a waist-cincher.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>41% recycled nylon, 41% nylon, 18% elastane | <strong>Sizes: </strong>XXS-4XL | <strong>Style: </strong>Bodysuit | <strong>Colors: </strong>Onyx, espresso, cocoa, jasper, bronze, sienna, ochre, clay, mica, sand</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-strapless-commando-tech-control-strapless-slip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Strapless</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Commando Tech Control Strapless Slip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Commando Tech Control Strapless Slip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/bIQEGkNEO8LFHEMXzxdHR8SXysI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Commando-Tech-Control-Strapless-Slip-ac9a82bbd3df46ec9100231257cb8c17.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a piece of shapewear that pairs well under strapless dress styles, look no further. The Commando Tech Control Strapless Slip is our top pick for this category because it not only features a strapless design but also has lightweight compression to provide some smoothing on the tummy area, sculpts the waist, hips, and butt. It's also stretchy enough to fit comfortably over the body without making you feel like you’re too restricted.

The shapewear also forgoes the compression at the bust area, so you don’t have to worry about it feeling too tight, and it has adjustable straps for an even better fit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>80% nylon, 20% spandex | <strong>Sizes: </strong>2XS-5XL | <strong>Style: </strong>Bodysuit | <strong>Colors: </strong>Beige, black, umber, blue, pink</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tank-shapermint-essentials-all-day-every-day-scoop-neck-compression-cami></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Tank</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shapermint Essentials All Day Every Day Scoop Neck Compression Cami</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Shapermint Scoop Neck Compression Cami" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Ln-Jb3FV7TP4UJkhveoB1TFivDk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Shapermint-Scoop-Neck-Compression-Cami-e339bee5d37f42ffa83b119d469bf594.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The best shapewear tank top for tummy control is the Shapermint Scoop Neck Compression Cami, which features adjustable spaghetti straps and stretches down past the hips to smooth the belly, waist, and hips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-92 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Constructed from a durable, breathable, and compressive nylon material, the top stretches easily over the body without losing its shape.

With this in mind, Sheila Attari, the founder and CEO of SheBird, says to look for flexible fabrics and designs. “Look for material that has a four-way stretch to keep you comfortable all day,” she explains. At the end of the day, you want the shapewear to do its job but you also want to be comfortable, which is why stretch is super important. For stretchier styles, consider the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Wolford Tulle Forming Underbust Shaper Thong Bodysuit</a><strong> </strong>which has over 30 percent stretch and is designed with plenty of comfortable flexibility so you can feel supported while still being able to move.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Comfortable Fabric</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to stretch, Richards says to make sure the fabric in general is comfortable, breathable, and not restrictive. “Nylon and spandex are key shapewear fabrics that deliver on stretch and flexibility so you’ll feel comfortable all day long,” she explains. Most nylon shapewear fabrics have moisture-wicking properties, too, which is ideal for warmer climates (or year round if you tend to run hot).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a comfortable nylon-based shapewear style, consider the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Shapermint High Waisted Body Shaper Shorts</a>.

Since shapewear is compressive, it should fit snug against the body. To ensure you have the right fit, Richards says to always purchase your usual size. “Purchasing it in too big of a size can reduce the shaping and smoothing features,” she explains. “I also do not recommend purchasing shapewear a size smaller as it can be uncomfortable and restricting.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What's the difference between tummy tucker and shapewear?</span></p><p>According to Richards, some use tummy tucker and shapewear interchangeably. “A tummy tucker targets the abdomen whereas shapewear is the category of garments that a tummy tucker is within,” she explains, adding that there are many different types of tummy control shapewear, including tummy tuckers, shaping panties, shaping shorts, and shaping tops.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word For It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jessie Quinn</a> is a contributing commerce writer for PEOPLE and has written for publications such as Byrdie, InStyle, The Spruce, NYLON, and more.
