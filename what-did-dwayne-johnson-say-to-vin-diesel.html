My male costars, however, are a different story. Some conduct themselves as stand up men and true professionals, while others don't."&nbsp;</p><p>"The ones that don't are too chicken s*** to do anything about it anyway,” he continued. “Candy a****. When you watch this movie next April and it seems like I'm not acting in some of these scenes and my blood is legit boiling — you're right."</p><p>In response, Diesel told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Today</a>, “I think some things may be blown out of proportion. I don't think that was his intention. I know he appreciates how much I work this franchise. In my house, he’s Uncle Dwayne.”</p><p>Diesel revealed in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Men's Health</a> feature in June that the "tough love" he offered The Rock to coax a good performance out of him in the Fast films was what caused the reported feud.</p><p>“My approach at the time was a lot of tough love to assist in getting that performance where it needed to be,” Diesel said in the interview. “As a producer to say, ‘Okay, we’re going to take Dwayne Johnson, who’s associated with wrestling, and we’re going to force this cinematic world, audience members, to regard his character as someone that they don’t know.’”</p><h2>What did Vin Diesel tell Dwayne Johnson?</h2><p>In a November 7, 2021, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post</a>, Diesel said: “My little brother Dwayne ... the time has come.</p><p>“The world awaits the finale of Fast 10,” he wrote. “As you know, my children refer to you as Uncle Dwayne in my house. There is not a holiday that goes by that they and you don't send well wishes... but the time has come.</p><p>"Legacy awaits, I swore that we would reach and manifest the best Fast in the finale that is 10! I say this out of love ... but you must show up, do not leave the franchise idle you have a very important role to play.</p><p>"Hobbs can't be played by no other, I hope that you rise to the occasion and fulfill your destiny.”</p><p>Diesel also mentioned late co-star <a href=#>Paul Walker</a> in the post, referring to him as “Pablo,” and writing that he told Johnson that he was going to “fulfill his promise” to the deceased actor of having “the best” finale to the Furious franchise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000647068665.jpg><h2>What did Dwayne Johnson say to Vin Diesel?&nbsp;</h2><p>In response to Diesel’s November post and caption, Johnson told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a> on December 30: “This past June, when Vin and I actually connected, not over social media, I told him directly — and privately — that I would not be returning to the franchise.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“I was firm yet cordial with my words and said that I would always be supportive of the cast and always root for the franchise to be successful, but that there was no chance I would return,” said The Rock.</p><p>He also labeled Diesel's post an "example of his manipulation," saying that he didn't like Diesel bringing up his own children or the death of Walker.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsY2x9d4SPaK6hmaRisaqwjJ2umrGemnqru8enqqimXaiuunnTqGSvoZ5isaqx0p6jaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./amazon-prime-day-2023-outlet-deals-7554292.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amazons Secret Outlet Is Packed with Jaw-Dropping Deals for Prime Day">&larr;
