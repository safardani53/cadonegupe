He also admitted that he used to bring girls to his shop and mess with them.</p><p>"We took him to the cemetery in Khan Yunis, without telling him what we were going to do. I tied his eyes with a rag so he couldn't see, put him in a large grave I saw, and suffocated him with a rag I had.</p><p>“After strangling him, I wrapped him in a white cloth and closed the grave. I understood from Rasmi that he realised that he deserved to die."</p><p>The documents, first revealed by the Israeli paper <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Israel Hayom</a>, suggest Sinwar also told the investigators that although he had a gun he preferred to kill with his hands.</p><p>In a second murder, Sinwar kidnapped a man called Adnan Safur. After beating him Sinwar claimed Safur had admitted collaborating with Israel.</p><p>"I suffocated him with a keffiyeh (Arab scarf), we dug in the place and Rawhi and I buried him there," Sinwar admitted.</p><p>In another case he abducted a man called Fathi Issa from a refugee camp.</p><p>Sinwar told investigators. "We got out of the vehicle, threatened him with a gun, and shoved him in the car. From there we drove to an orchard and I interrogated Fathi.</p><p>"I grabbed his throat with one hand and started choking him, with the other hand I punched him in the stomach and suddenly he had a heart attack and died.”</p><p>He described burying the body in an orchard.</p><p>A fourth murder was a man called Hussein al-Sir, also from Khan Yunis, described as “a wealthy man who used to show off his Mercedes car”.</p><p>Sinwar said: "When we found him inside his vehicle, I took out the gun and threatened him. I put the gun to his neck, I told him 'get in my car', and when he got out of his car he started to resist.</p><p>"I pressed the gun to his neck so that he would get in the car, but then a bullet came out and hit him because I left the hatch open. We quickly put him in the car and drove away.”</p><p>Sinwar said Hussein was buried behind a factory adding: “After that, we washed the car of the blood and all the marks and went home.”</p><p>After the files emerged, one of his interrogators, Michael Koubi, said Sinwar had told him he had another suspected collaborator buried alive by his brother, who was a member of Hamas.</p><p>“That’s what Yahya Sinwar was like,” Koubi told the German news magazine <a href=#>Der Spiegel</a>.</p><p>Koubi, now 78, said in total, Sinwar admitted to having committed 12 murders in 150 to 180 hours of interrogation.</p><p>But at no time did Sinwar ever smile. He had seemed, Koubi said, “like a man without emotions”.</p><p>Asked by Koubi why, in his late 20s, Sinwar had no wife or children, he replied: "Hamas is my wife, my son, my daughter, my parents. Hamas is everything to me.”</p><p>After his interrogation by Koubi, Sinwar was convicted of multiple murders, including two Israeli soldiers, and sentenced to five life sentences and a full life term in prison.</p><p>But he served just over 20-years and, along with Yassin and hundreds of Hamas terrorists, was released in October 2011 as part of a prisoner exchange for kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.</p><p>By that time he had gathered huge influence and power among Hamas prisoners. Soon after he emerged a free man, he became Hamas’s leader in Gaza.</p><p>And his plot to bring horror to Israel just a few miles from his home gathered in momentum until its bloody crescendo on October 7.</p><p>Now, after the massacre of of more than 1,200 people at the hands of Hamas, estimates suggest as many as 20,000 Palestinans have died in the Israeli invasion of Gaza.</p><p>Much of the narrow strip of land has been decimated by air strikes, artillery and street fighting. Among the dead, Israel says are hundreds of Hamas terrorists.</p><p>And amid the rubble, the blood and the death, Sinwar hides, almost certainly in one of the miles of tunnels that haven’t been obliterated by the Israelis.</p><p>Above him lie thousands of Israeli troops, the rubble of a city and the bodies of thousands of innocents.</p><p>If, or more likely when, Sinwar is found, it will almost certainly be within a few miles of where he was born and raised in a refugee camp in the Hamas stronghold of Khan Younis in southern Gaza.</p><p>For the Hamas military leader who triggered a war which has killed so many innocents, the end will probably come as a blinding flash as an Israeli shell, rocket or bullet finds him.</p><p>It is unlikely he will be dragged by the collar from a dusty tunnel shaft and paraded for the cameras.</p><p>Shin Bet agent Koubi claims during his interrogation, Sinwar was convinced the day would come when Hamas would “destroy Israel”.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>And until Sinwar is found, Israel believes the threat remains.</p><p>Koubi said: "It was clear to me even then that Hamas was our biggest enemy. What we’re doing now in Gaza was long overdue.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/division-98-idfs-special-forces-864725085-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-holds-863372384-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/b35731d2-0dd9-4285-be99-04782aa3d4cd.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WIPS_5jpg-JS211983940-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4JzfpJraHBnqZa1uq2MrKCnr5Gneq7B0Z2cq6tdnru1sdGrpqCZpJ68r3nFoqOeq18%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./danneel-harris-supernaturals-jensen-didnt-cry-over-kids-births.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Danneel Harris: Supernatural's Jensen Didnt Cry Over Kids Births">&larr;
