The 52-year-old is extremely successful in the food industry, between his plethora of addicting shows on Food Network and slew of popular restaurants around the globe.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But he hasn't been famous forever, which is why there have been questions raised about how he got his start. <strong>Scroll down for everything we know about Guy's road to success!</strong></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did Guy Fieri get his start?</h2><p>So it turns out, Guy Fieri became famous for winning a game show! That's right, although he was already a restauranter before winning, he was crowned the champion of the second season of The Next Food Network Star in 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Winning that show really kick-started Guy's career, as he scored a six-episode cooking show called Guy's Big Bite because of it. The series ran from 2006 until 2016, airing nearly 200 episodes throughout its whopping 19 seasons.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But Guy's Big Bite wasn't the only series that made the bright personality such a household name. His second (and arguably most popular series) Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives premiered in April 2007 and is still airing new episodes to this day. Yes, Guy has been touring the world showing us some of the greatest restaurant bites for 13 whole years, and to be honest, we don't see that show coming to an end anytime soon.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Some of the other popular shows that he's hosted or appeared in over the years include Dear Food Network (2007-2009), Ultimate Recipe Showdown (2008-2010), The Best Thing I Ever Ate (2009-2011), Guy Fieri's Rock 'n Road Show (2011), The Best Thing I Ever Made (2011-2012), Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off (2012-2014), Guy's Grocery Games (2013-present), Guy's Ranch Kitchen (2017-2018), Guy's Family Road Trip (2017), Guy & Hunter's European Vacation (2016), and Tournament of Champions (2020).</p><p>Guy is also prominent in the restaurant world, having owned three locations of Johnny Garlic's, a California Pasta Grill, and one Tex Wasabi's before he became famous. He also now owns a number of successful restaurants that blossomed after his big TV win in 2006 until now.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>During a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Food Network interview</a> in 2016, he opened up about his stardom from The Next Food Network Star, and revealed he's extremely humbled by his success. "I keep in touch with my friends that I was on Season 2 with — most of them — and I think about where it’s taken me and the opportunities it’s given me, and I’m very humbled," Guy said a few years back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I mean, it’s probably the most-amazing thing besides, you know, having my family. It’s mind-blowing. I mean, it’s really mind-blowing, and to see the opportunities that are coming available to all these young chefs that are trying out for this, I wish them all the best, and I thank Food Network," he added. "I think Food Network has done a tremendous job at fortifying the world with a true exposure to the life of food in all different facets."</p><p>Guy concluded: "I attribute a tremendous amount of the success that we’ve had as a culture in getting back to real food, in getting back to cooking, and getting the family back to the dinner table. These are all realities that are taking place, and, again, I really attribute a tremendous amount of that to Food Network, and I feel blessed to be a member of the team. Ten years — I’m getting to O.G. status."&nbsp;</p><p>We're wishing him many more years of success and fame on Food Network and beyond!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecOim2afpa56p7XEq6Bmn5Wpeqm10maqrZmiqQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kaitlin-olson-rob-mcelhenney-won-signed-kylie-kelce-eagles-jacket.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kaitlin Olson, Rob McElhenney Won Signed Kylie Kelce Eagles Jacket">&larr;
