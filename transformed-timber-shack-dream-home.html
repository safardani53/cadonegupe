And, at times, it looked like it wouldn’t happen at all.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More in Transformations">Read More in Transformations</h2><p>The show, which airs on Thursdays at 8pm and is hosted by Mark Millar, sees the foodie couple explaining their clear vision for the property which lies on an impressive one and a half acres of land.</p><p>Mike, who has four grown up children of his own, said: “When we first drove by the property, it was so overgrown.</p><p>“Metal and weeds six feet high, holes in the roof and half the chimney had gone. It definitely looked like a project.”&nbsp;</p><p>However, mum-of-two Lucy revealed that the pair – who fell in love after meeting through work three years ago – were more than happy to take on the project and build a spacious four-bedroom property.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>Their plans included solar panels, high thermal efficiency roof lights, and a huge open plan kitchen and living area that opened onto a huge garden complete with an outdoor kitchen and wildlife area.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucy added that also had ambitious plans to live off the land, including a ‘jungle room’ where Lucy could grow tropical fruits.</p><p>In keeping with their eco-friendly project, they also wanted to ensure they did everything they could to recycle along the way – even bagging items for free where possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucy: “We’ve literally got windows out of people’s skips.</p><p>“So all those horrible UPVC white windows that everyone’s desperate to rip out of their properties are actually really energy efficient.”</p><p>We’ve literally got windows out of people’s skips</p><span class=quote-credit>Lucy</span><p>However, just as things were coming together and the project was ticking along nicely, the couple’s worst nightmare came true.</p><p>Lucy and Mike had run out of money and could no longer afford to pay the contractors or builders.&nbsp;</p><p>But not letting that get in the way of their end goal, the determined duo took matters into their own hands.</p><p>Despite continuing with their day jobs, they also managed to graft day and night until the house started to look like their goal.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucy even recalled going to bed before her young daughter due to feeling “sheer exhaustion.”</p><p>This is the home that I really dreamed of – and we built it</p><span class=quote-credit>Lucy</span><p>Mike explained: “We ran out of money two months before the finish, and did it ourselves.”</p><p>Lucy continued: “The whole running out of money thing was almost part of the plan because we knew we never had enough money to do it basically.”</p><p>But Lucy was quick to add that the eight-month build was worth all the sweat and tears.</p><p>The couple gave viewers a look around the impressive home which had everything they’d set out to do, including underfloor heating and&nbsp;lots of space for the children to play.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>She exclaimed: “This is what we wanted. This is the house and the home that I really dreamed of – and we built it!”</p><p><strong>Build Your Dream Home in the Country airs Thursdays at 8pm on Channel 5.
