Hope you had a lovely holiday. Text me when you get back. Love, Stuart. x"</p><p>Another said: "Hi Princess, in case you missed my last note I just thought I'd pop in another to let you know that I do miss your smile xx".</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>POLICE INTERVIEW</strong></h2><p>One Essex cop described Campbell's bizarre and disturbing behaviour during the police interview.</p><p>"I vividly remember Stuart Campbell sitting opposite me.</p><p>"He couldn't maintain any form of eye contact. He wasn't having any form of conversation.</p><p>"He was so noncommittal and nonplussed around the whole event he just didn't care.</p><p>"He said 'No comment' at least 50 times during a 20 minute interview.</p><p>"At no time did Stuart Campbell display the feelings of a concerned uncle. He displayed the feelings of self-preservation.</p><p>"His lack of cooperation meant that we honed in completely."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS</strong></h2><p>Cops also revealed that Campbell had gotten into trouble with the police on more than one occasion before Danielle's disappearance.</p><p>One detective described a "previous conviction and offence for the abduction of a 14-year-old girl in 1989", which had culminated in the conviction of a much lesser offence; taking a child without lawful authority.</p><p>The family apparently knew that he had previous convictions, but were unaware of the full extent.</p><p>When they found out the details of Campbell's disturbing past, they were horrified.</p><p>"He had at least 20 years of serial offending, they were able to go back and identify about 30 victims.</p><p>"We had allegations of indecent photography, indecent assault and rape," one detective revealed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000477768584.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>FAKE ALIBI</strong></h2><p>CCTV later showed that Campbell's alleged alibi - that he'd been shopping at a DIY store when Danielle disappeared - was false.</p><p>No vehicles matching either the blue transit van or silver family car were seen pulling up to the shop he claimed to be at on footage trawled through by cops.</p><p>He also claimed to have rung his wife on his way home, to let her know he was delayed by traffic.</p><p>But analysis by a phone expert showed that he was likely speaking from somewhere near his home address, and not en route home from the shop.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>HORROR FINDS IN CAMPBELL'S HOUSE</strong></h2><p>The convicted killer was found to have approached teenage girls with business cards claiming to be a glamour photographer, collecting intimate images of children and storing them in his home.</p><p>"The photos didn't end up anywhere, they weren't in any publication.</p><p>"This was just him, getting his jollies, making out that he was a glamour photographer," one cop said.</p><p>"He absolutely had a type and Danielle was his type."</p><p>During the search of Campbell's home, cops found what they described as the 'Danielle diary'.</p><p>"It was noting various incidents involving the two of them. there was a lot of detail, almost an obsession.</p><p>"When a grown man like that starts writing a diary about his 15-year-old niece, all the interactions, its beyond weird.</p><p>"It is creepy, it is unsettling, its disturbing."</p><p>A green hold-all was also discovered in his home, with lingerie, handcuffs and condoms.</p><p>Police believed he had used some of it to dress up young girls and sent it off for DNA testing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>'MARKS' ON DANIELLE'S NECK</strong></h2><p>One of the entries in his diary mentioned a day that police asked Danielle's parents about.</p><p>Linda remembered Campbell dropping Danielle home after she had been at his house, as she ran straight upstairs to her room.</p><p>He told Linda that Danielle had taken a "funny turn", passed out and wet herself.</p><p>Linda later saw some marks on her neck, assuming they were from the chain she wore.</p><p>Danielle apparently assumed she had passed out, and was upset and embarrassed when her mum spoke to her.</p><p>One of the detectives said police believe Campbell had attempted to incapacitate and assault her that day, after finding notes about chloroform in his diary and a statement from a neighbour.</p><p>The neighbour apparently heard a disagreement between him and a young girl, who they believed to be Danielle, where he effectively told her she didn't have to do anything she didn't want to.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>WITNESS SIGHTING</strong></h2><p>One witness, who lived in the area, told police that she saw something disturbing on the morning of June 18.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>She saw a girl fitting Danielle's description arguing with a man they believed fit the description of Campbell.</p><p>Danielle then apparently said: "No, leave me alone, go away you pervert".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tony-linda-jones-parents-danielle-2503716.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000477768585.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4F3g5dvam1nk6HCpr%2BMnZinoZWhuaZ5yailnqtdosKzsMSrZKyspZa%2FtXnCmqSpmpWhuW6uzp2wZpyfmMKusc2tmKuxXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./amanda-balionis-husband-wedding.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amanda Balionis And Her Husband Mark One Year Anniversary">&larr;
