Outback Saturn Pro 4 Burner Gas BBQ</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.thcdn.com/images/large/webp//productimg/1600/1600/13950666-9275022386771814.jpg><ul><li><strong>Outback Saturn Pro 4 Burner Gas BBQ, £468 (saving £52) from Homebase - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>We love the striking navy colour of this Outback BBQ, which at the time of writing, is 10% off at Homebase.</p><p>The model has just been updated for 2023, and comes with all the features you'd expect from a high-quality BBQ: a double skin hood that prevents rust and scratches; a porcelain enamal-coated warming rack, which ensures a non-stick surface for meat to rest on once it's cooked; a side burner (alongside the four stainless steel main burners); and some thoughtful additions like an in built wooden chopping board and a magnetic bottle opener.</p><p>There's also inbuilt middle shelf for storage, as well as two stainless steel removeable utility baskets.</p><p>Homebase customers love this BBQ, with 100% of respondents saying they'd recommend it to a friend.</p><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 118.5 x 139.5 x 62.1cm <strong>Burners: </strong>4 (plus side burner) <strong>Main burners output (KW): </strong>12.96kW, 2.94kW for side burner</p><h2>2. Weber Genesis E-335 GBS BBQ</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/product-images.weber.com/35410004B_1800x1800.png><ul><li><strong>Weber Genesis E-335 Gas Barbecue, £1,719 from Weber – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Large grill area, easy to clean, digital thermometer and temperature controls</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Expensive, big and heavy to move around</p><p>It's extremely easy to baulk at the price of the new Weber Genesis — you could probably take a holiday for the same price — but it's hard to overstate just how good this barbecue is.</p><p>Of course, you probably are paying a portion of the £1,719 price tag for the brand name, but that's because the Weber logo comes with both pedigree and an assurance of quality: and if you do still have concerns, you'll be calmed by the knowledge that some of its components come with a 12-year warranty.</p><p>You can tell its sturdiness just by its heft: it weighs in at around 70 kilograms, thanks to a total cooking area of more than 5m2 and an abundance of stainless steel, and it feels extremely well built and solid, even compared to other wildly expensive barbecues. You feel a sense of satisfaction and approval doing something as simple as lifting up the lid. Its size and weight do mean that it's a bit of a pain to move around, but it comes with four wheels and excellent-quality brakes, meaning that portability is as swift and safe as it can be.</p><p>There are little things, too, that makes it a well-designed bit of kit: the drip tray at the bottom slides out completely, making it easy to empty and clean, and the gas canister sits inside the unit, making it more compact and neat (although it does take up a decent amount of space).</p><p>As expected for the price, it also comes with every bell and whistle you can imagine, including a Bluetooth function that links to the Weber app, allowing you to keep an eye on the temperature of your food — handy if you're cooking a bigger piece of meat such as a tomahawk steak. You can also keep an eye on the temperature of the BBQ using the bang-on digital thermometer, although it needs to be plugged in for this to work.</p><p>It also comes with Weber's largest and hottest Sear Zone, and we noticed a definite improvement in the quality of the food compared to other barbecues we've tried, with better char and colour. That's also thanks to main burners that have a massive 11.4kw of energy, as well as great temperature adjustability and technology that minimises the number of flare-ups, which negatively affect the taste of your food.</p><p>You're also not limited to grilling: you can use the side burner to saute veg or warm sauces, and it's compatible with Weber's Gourmet BBQ System, which allows you to cook on it using a whole host of kitchenware from woks to dutch ovens to rotisseries. Realistically, in the summer (and in the winter when it's dry, thanks to a light for night-time grilling), the Weber Genesis could be your main method of cooking.</p><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>123.19cm H x 157.48cm W x 68.58cm D <strong>Burners: </strong>3 (plus side and sear burners)&nbsp;<strong>Main burners output (KW): </strong>11.4</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong></p><h2>3. Landmann Rexon MCS Cook 3.1</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0602/9371/0037/products/a319b260-453a-468f-b590-74e35b9422ba_1800x1202.jpg><ul><li><strong>Landmann Rexon MCS Cook 3.1, £419.99 at Robert Dyas - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Good value, easy set up, good temperature control, big cooking rack</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Not a lot</p><p>At under £500, the Landmann Rexon is great value for money as it has tons of handy features.</p><p>It's an imposing presence, made in gunmetal grey with Landmann's red fire logo emblazoned on each dial. In fact, it's a rather striking BBQ, overall. If you fancy a bit more of a retro look, there is a similar model (albeit with four burners) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">available in red from Argos.</a></p><p>We also found this relatively easy to set up — it took one person just a couple of hours thanks to easy-to-follow instructions (something that can't be said for many gas BBQs, which are accompanied by leaflets seemingly written in hieroglyphics).</p><p>And once it's set up, it feels sturdy — with a weighty double-skinned lid, an enclosed cabinet with double doors, four wheels and enough cooking space to make food for 12 people, you really get the feeling that Landmann isn't a fan of cutting corners.</p><p>This is also demonstrated by an attention to detail. The enamel-coated stainless steel cooking rack is nice and big and keeps meat warm while it's resting; the adjustability of the temperature is impressive, allowing flexibility while cooking; and there's a separate burner on the side, on which you can cook side dishes, which isn't something you often find on a BBQ of this price point.</p><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong><i> W135 x H120 x D52cm</i> <strong>Burners: </strong><i>3 (plus side burner)&nbsp;</i><strong>Main burners output (KW): </strong><i>11.1kW</i></p><h2>4. Napoleon Freestyle 365 SIB</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.napoleon.com/sites/default/files/products/F365-SIB-GT-DE-Prod-Str-Closed-Lid-Shlf-Up-800px.png><ul><li><strong>Napoleon Freestyle 365 SIB, £617.49 from BBQ World - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Good value, good temperature control, generous cooking area</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Complicated set-up</p><p>The Napoleon Freestyle 365 slots neatly between the Weber and the Landmann into the midrange, price-wise, and it's a mean bit of kit.</p><p>That's especially true for this version, which comes with the addition of a mighty infrared side burner; an upgrade we can fully condone splashing out a bit extra on.</p><p>With this model, you get an infrared section that is amazing for getting the perfect colour on your meat, or, if you wanted, making side dishes to accompany your grilled food.</p><p>Thanks to beefy 15KW burners that ignite instantly, food cooks quickly and sears well, but there is also great flexibility thanks to the fact that you can take the heat down to an impressively low level — it's not all or nothing.</p><p>The main cooking area is also generous for the price, measuring 51 x 45, and we easily cooked for a party of 12 people with food left over. Generous too is the warranty, with many parts protected for your whole life.</p><p>Small touches we loved include the bottle opener on the side (while not a sophisticated accessory, once you have it, you can't live without it) and the curved grilles, which give characteristic sear marks to your meat and also seem to make it more difficult for things to fall through. They also contribute to a very stylish overall look, alongside elegant touches of steel and carbon.</p><p>Our only gripe was that the instructions for setting it up weren't super clear — it took two (admittedly incompetent) people the better part of an entire morning to construct it, though it would take slightly less time if you got the version without the side burner.</p><p>Overall, if you're not looking to spend four figures on a gas barbecue and want ultimate practicality, you can't do much better than the Napoleon Freestyle.</p><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong><i> W124 x H116 x D64cm</i> <strong>Burners: </strong><i>3 (plus side burner)&nbsp;</i><strong>Main burners output (KW): </strong><i>12KW</i></p><h2>5.

You can rest it on a warm tray on the top BBQ rack, away from the direct heat.</li><li>Make sure you get your salads done before you start cooking the meat, it just makes for an easier cooking experience.</li></ul><h2>How much does a gas BBQ cost?</h2><p>There’s usually a big price difference between options from well-known brands and barbecues available at supermarkets and DIY stores.&nbsp;We've seen a range of prices, from around £100 to more than £4,000.</p><p>Although price is not always an indicator of quality, products from popular brands tend to be more robust and built with better quality material.</p><p>Budget-friendly models are often more cheaply made and less durable, so if you're planning on using your barbecue regularly it's worth spending a bit more.</p><h2>Where to buy a barbecue</h2><p>Gas BBQs are in high demand right now, so you have to shop around a bit to find what you want in stock.</p><p>We've listed a few retailers below for some inspiration.</p><h2><strong>What gas do you use for a barbecue?</strong></h2><p>The gas used for barbecues is usually propane, although butane may be an option if the correct gas regulator is available.</p><p>Propane is better suited to year-round use (especially during colder weather) and many barbecues come with a propane regulator.</p><p>Butane has its own benefits, especially if you’re only going to be cooking during warmer weather, as butane won’t flow during colder conditions.</p><p>Butane is slightly cheaper and is considered to be more environmentally friendly and efficient when burning in warm weather.</p><p>For expert advice on which gas to choose and availability, check with specialists like B&Q or Calor.</p><h2><strong>Where to buy gas for a barbecue</strong></h2><p>You can buy barbecue gas from a range of online or local stockists.</p><p>Like barbecues themselves, gas bottles may be stocked by garden centres or registered outlets like B&Q stores.</p><p>Alternatively, you may order online directly from Calor, or suppliers like Flogas, London Gases or Adams Gas, but availability will depend on whether you want a refill or a new bottle.</p><p>If you’re new to purchasing gas for a barbecue, make sure to get as much advice as possible before you buy.</p><h2><strong>How much is barbecue gas?</strong></h2><p>Gas bottles can vary in price depending on whether you buy a refill or new bottle, and whether you want to opt for butane or propane.</p><p>A 5-6kg propane gas refill will usually cost around £30, while a new bottle can cost in the region of £60.</p><p>Where available, a 7kg butane refill will cost around £30.</p><h2><strong>How to clean a gas barbecue</strong></h2><p>Gas barbecues are best cleaned after every use to prevent build-ups of grime and food remains.</p><p>But, given you’ll likely want to enjoy the fruits of your labour when just cooked, it’s a good idea to set aside time to do it later or the day after use.</p><p>First, refer to any cleaning instructions that come with your barbecue. A wire brush, a bucket of hot soapy water and some protective gloves are your allies.</p><p>It may be easier to clean off grime when the barbecue is slightly heated too, so turning on the barbecue to ‘high’ for a very short while beforehand may help.</p><p>But ensure the barbecue is off, disconnected and you are wearing protective gloves before cleaning.</p><p>If the grills and any drip pans are removable, soaking these first may help.</p><p>Then it's just a case of brushing down, rinsing and drying.</p><p>The wire brush may also help you clean the interior of your gas barbecue, including the hood, while wiping down the outside can usually be done with soapy water and a cloth.</p><p>Specialist barbecue cleaning products are available but check they are suitable before you use them, especially if your grill is coated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZnFtY2h%2FdYSOm5ysrF2crrR5wZqpm52TqrK0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./james-scully.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="James Scully Biography">&larr;
