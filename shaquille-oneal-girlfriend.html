The Newark, N.J., native used his stellar basketball career to create multiple businesses and to star in even more brand endorsements. But, as it turns out, even basketball icons have trouble finding love in these streets.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Shaq has been married and divorced and is a <a href=#>father to six children</a> from previous relationships. The retired athlete has also <a href=#>dated several women</a> within the entertainment industry and is rumored to be currently dating a <a href=#>Chicago Fire</a> alum.</p><p>Here’s everything we know about Shaq’s current girlfriend!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Shaquille O’Neal’s girlfriend?

The person alongside him was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Annette “Annie” Ilonzeh</a>, a Nigerian American actor.</p><p>It’s unclear how she and Shaq met but they likely crossed paths because they’re both in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Annie, who is 11 years younger than Shaq, started acting in the mid-2000s. She appeared in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several TV shows,</a> including How I Met Your Mother, The Game, and American Horror Story.</p><p>After landing multiple recurring TV roles and movie roles, Annie received her first leading role as <a href=#>Emily Foster in Chicago Fire.</a></p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Annie starred as Emily for two seasons of the popular NBC hit. However, in 2020, the show’s writers wrote her character off the show. The departure reportedly happened because of a contract dispute between Annie and Chicago Fire’s management company.</p><p>Since her exit, the Grapevine, Texas, native has moved on to other roles, including 2022’s Agent Game alongside <a href=#>Adam Canto</a> and Dermot Mulroney.</p><p>She’s also still close to her Chicago Fire co-star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Kyri</a>, who plays Darren Ritter. The actors tagged each other on Instagram as “mom and dad,” and Annie wrote in her bio that she’s Daniel’s "other half."</p><p>Annie and Shaq don’t share their relationship on Instagram, but they were last spotted together in July 2022. So, it is unknown if they are still dating.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Shaquille O’Neal has been open about his past relationships not working out.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Shaq and Annie’s privacy seems to be working for the couple. The Big Shamrock could be less willing to discuss his relationship because of the mistakes he admittedly made in previous ones.</p><p>Before Annie, Shaq had a very public marriage to Basketball Wives EP and star <a href=#>Shaunie O’Neal</a>. Shaunie and Shaq got married in 2002 and raised four children together — Shareef, Shaqir, Amirah, and Me’Arah. According to People, Shaq also helped raise Shaunie’s son, Myles, from a previous relationship.</p><p>Shaq and Shaunie had been married for nearly a decade when Shaunie filed for divorce in 2011. The VH1 star left Shaq amid reports of infidelity.</p><p>The divorce cost him $100,000, and Shaq took full responsibility for his actions. In a November 2022 cover story in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, he admitted "I was a d--khead," to his ex-wife, who married <a href=#>Pastor Keion Henderson</a> in May 2022.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Shaq’s other exes include Arnetta Yarborough, who is the mother of his daughter Taahirah.

The NBA analyst revealed on J<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">immy Kimmel Live!</a> that he once tried meeting someone on Tinder. Unsurprisingly, the woman Shaq reached out to passed on the offer and thought he was a catfish.</p><p>“I signed up for Tinder, put in my name, and I tried to make a person meet me,” he explained to Jimmy. “And they didn’t believe it was me. I was like, ‘It’s me, it’s Shaq.’ ... And she said, ‘Shaq would never be on this.’ So I had to hit delete.
