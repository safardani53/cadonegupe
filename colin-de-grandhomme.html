From 2006 to 2018, he represented Auckland in New Zealand domestic cricket. He played for Warwickshire County Cricket Club in England in 2017 after playing for Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2017 Indian Premier League.</p><p>He signed with Northern Districts in May 2018 ahead of the 2018-19 New Zealand domestic season. In the 2018 and 2019 IPL seasons, he was a member of Royal Challengers Bangalore. He was signed by Hampshire for the T20 Blast in May 2021 and drafted by Southern Brave for the inaugural season of The Hundred in 2021.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Colin-de-Grandhomme-1-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Colin de Grandhomme Height, Weight</h2><p><span><strong>Colin de Grandhomme</strong> is 6 feet tall. He weighs approximately 80 kg. He has lovely warm black eyes and Black locks. There is no information on his chest-waist-hip measurements, dress size, shoe size, biceps, and so on.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Career</h2><ul><li>Colin de Grandhomme advanced to the international circuit after a string of impressive domestic performances. Last year, he hit three hundred for Auckland in the Plunket Shield, with his medium pace option providing an added boost. He also played an important all-round role in Auckland’s HRV T20 Cup victory in 2010-11.</li><li>In 2012, he was called up to the Blackcaps squad for the home series against Zimbabwe and South Africa. Grandhomme, who was born in Zimbabwe, represented his country in the Under-19 World Cup in 2004 before moving to New Zealand in search of better opportunities.</li><li>In 2012-13, the shorter formats received a national call-up. His ball-striking abilities and utility medium pace made him an excellent choice for limited-overs cricket.</li><li>However, it was in his Test debut that de Grandhomme made the biggest impression. In the summer of 2016, he ran riot at home against Pakistan on seaming pitches where his medium pace was sufficient as long as accuracy was present.</li><li>His six-for on debut was the best by a New Zealand debutant. Although he has not been a regular in the Test side since then, de Grandhomme is frequently considered on pitches with movement.</li><li>The reason for this is his ability to move the ball at a moderate pace – a skill that improves significantly on greenish tracks. Aside from that, his counter-attacking batting abilities are a plus.</li><li>Although de Grandhomme’s career is still in its early stages, his ability to turn a match on its head makes him a valuable player to have, particularly in white-ball cricket.</li><li>If New Zealand decides to change their Test batting order, he could become a regular in the longest format as well. Although we have seen glimpses of de Grandhomme’s talent, it is safe to say that he has yet to fully translate his potential on the international stage.</li><li>New Zealand’s obsession with all-rounders is well known, and the Kiwis will be hoping that de Grandhomme can cement his spot across formats in the coming years.</li><li>The 2016-17 season was a watershed moment for de Grandhomme. He not only made his Test debut but he was also called up by the Kolkata Knight Riders to replace Andre Russell.</li><li>Despite playing for the majority of the season, de Grandhomme saw very few bat-and-ball opportunities. His standout performance was 3 for 4 against Bangalore on a seamer-friendly wicket at Eden Gardens.</li><li>The 2018 season marked the tenth anniversary of the IPL, and all teams looked to the future, and de Grandhomme was not in KKR’s plans. Bangalore purchased him for INR 2.2 crore, up from a base price of 75 lakh.</li><li>The change had no effect on his fortunes because he didn’t start the season and when he did, his chances were slim. However, with a T20 strike rate of 166, RCB did not want to lose the burly all-rounder.</li></ul><h2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Colin-de-Grandhomme-2-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><h2>Records</h2><ul><li>On December 2, 2017, he scored his first Test century against the West Indies in just 71 balls.
