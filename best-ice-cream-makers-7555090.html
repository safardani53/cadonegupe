If you’re an ice cream lover who’s still searching for the perfect flavor, having an ice cream maker at home means you’ll never have to skimp on toppings or sacrifice your favorite combination of ingredients. These fun kitchen gadgets are the key to customizing your sundae: Depending on the model you choose, you can create new flavors (like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jeni's controversial everything bagel ice cream</a>), control texture and hardness, and even add in the mix-ins of your choice.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In search of the best ice cream makers available, we put 20 of the leading models through a series of culinary tests to determine functionality, ease of use, performance, and most importantly — taste. We even tested the ice cream maker <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Jennifer Garner churned in an instagram reel</a> where she reminscienced about making ice cream with her childhood friend and wrote that “there is something to be said for getting back to basics.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><br>We couldn’t have said it better, so gather your kids, neighbors, friends, or just your favorite ingredients, and try one of the best ice cream makers People Tested.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-chefn-sweet-spot-ice-cream-maker></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chef'n Sweet Spot Ice Cream Maker</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chef'n Sweet Spot Ice Cream Maker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/r7YXARvD8Dnqxl0EntcDoLk0pk8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chefn-5255870-sweet-spot-ice-cream-maker-8081cbf36b16494ab1607644d2a55a87.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>It’s lightweight and takes up about as much space as a mixing bowl.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Solid, simple construction means it’s easy to understand and use.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This machine yielded some of the creamiest ice cream of all we tested.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It can also be used as a frozen margarita maker.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=1><p>Ice cream made in this machine freezes harder and faster than some of the other makers we tested, so be mindful when scooping.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It doesn’t yield as much ice cream as some of the other products do.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s not dishwasher-safe.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Out of all the products we tested, one of the simplest and most affordable ended up being our favorite. The Chef’n Sweet Spot Ice Cream Maker yielded some of the creamiest ice cream of all we tasted, with minimal set up, maintenance, and clean-up. It is a manual ice cream maker, but in the spirit of "getting back to basics," we decided we loved it more than any of the others we tested.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To use, simply prepare your ice cream base then pour it into the frozen bowl and use the included spatulas to mix it up. We found that the simplicity of this gadget aided in its overall convenience—it’s lightweight and about the size of a large mixing bowl, so it doesn’t take up too much space on the countertop and doesn’t have extra parts to wash.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout testing, this gadget performed exceptionally well — it made ice cream faster than any of the other products we tested and yielded creamy results with consistently dispersed mix-ins. Although it doesn’t yield as much ice cream as some of the larger, more advanced machines, it’s a great option for someone looking to experiment with making ice cream at home.&nbsp; (Plus, it doubles as a frozen margarita maker for hot summer nights.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Style: </strong>Manual | <strong>Accessories:</strong> 2 spatulas | <strong>Yield:</strong> 3/4 cup finished ice cream | <strong>Dishwasher Safe:</strong> No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-runner-up-ninja-creami-deluxe-11-in-1-xl-ice-cream-maker></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall, Runner Up</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ninja Creami Deluxe XL Ice Cream Maker</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ninja Creami Deluxe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3Zx0C_Rtf-8w588sOjIWIsKtoJc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NinjaCreamiDeluxe-a466b88475584963beee8a29bd159956.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>It yields consistently-creamy ice cream<strong> </strong>with no ice grit or separation.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It can also be used to make frozen cocktails or coffee beverages.</p></li><li readability=1><p>Though the parts are dishwasher-safe, they’re easy to clean by hand, too.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>The motor can be really noisy when in use.</p></li><li readability=0><p>It only yields 2 pints at a time, so it’s not great for making large batches.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another one of our favorite ice cream maker models is Ninja’s CREAMi Deluxe 11-in-1 Ice Cream & Frozen Treat Maker. This versatile gadget is electric, so it requires less manpower than the Chef’n Sweet Spot Ice Cream Maker, but it yields similarly-creamy results. However, its $250 price point kept it from being our top pick.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout the testing process we were thrilled at how easy this machine is to understand and use, and its performance and versatility made it stand out from the competition. Its compact size means it’s easy to store and doesn’t take up a ton of space, and we love that the controls are easy to read — especially for beginners. Eleven functions mean this electric ice cream maker is one of the more versatile options that we tested, and it can even be used to make frozen lattes or milkshakes. We love how hands-off this electric machine allows you to be, while still delivering exceptionally creamy results. This is a fantastic option for anyone looking for a compact gadget that can whip up different types of frozen treats. Keep in mind that because it’s on the smaller side, it doesn’t yield as much finished product as some of the other machines do.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Style: </strong>Electric | <strong>Accessories:</strong> Bowl and lid, creamer paddle, 2 pints with lids | <strong>Yield:</strong> 24 ounces finished ice cream | <strong>Dishwasher Safe:</strong> Removable parts, yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-cuisinart-15-quart-frozen-yogurt-ice-cream--sorbet-maker></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cuisinart Frozen Yogurt, Ice Cream, & Sorbet Maker</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Cuisinart 1.5-Quart Ice Cream Maker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/p9w2LpiBSwHR5EoLLbdQtww_xrM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cuisinart-1.5-Quart-Ice-Cream-Make-68e095fe37bb40bcb9e26e772942e071.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=3><li readability=1><p>It yields smooth, creamy, and consistently-mixed ice cream and sorbet.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The four feet provide a sturdy base, so this machine won’t move around while in use.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The machine is quiet and easy for beginners to understand and use.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Since this is such a simple machine, it’s great for kids or teenagers.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>The churning process takes longer than some of the other machines we tested.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Because this uses a frozen bowl method, you’ll need enough storage space to store the bowl.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This simple, easy-to-use electric ice cream maker is perfect for beginners or someone who isn’t looking to invest a ton of money into a new gadget. It utilizes a frozen bowl method — which means the technique is simple and it yields perfectly creamy results with mix-ins that are consistently incorporated. Throughout the testing process, we found that this machine was one of the simplest and most easy to use while still delivering top-tier results. The ice cream and sorbet were dense and creamy, without being runny or crystallized. It operates quickly, and the simple on and off switch was easy to understand and operate. We love that this machine has an ingredient spout so you can easily disperse ingredients without anything spilling out the side.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep in mind that this machine took longer to churn the ingredients than some of the others we tried.

Throughout our testing, it consistently delivered airy, fluffy ice cream that was sweet and light with toppings perfectly incorporated throughout. In fact, this machine delivered some of our favorite ice cream of all the products we tested. Its convenience was unmatched — in addition to being compact, it’s also super easy to clean. It’s easy to take apart and all of the pieces were easy to wash by hand, leaving no mess behind on the countertop or on the electric base of the machine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep in mind that this product should not be placed in the dishwasher, and abrasive cleaning products aren’t safe to use on the freezer bowl.

We love how easy it is to assemble and use, and the simple functionality means it’s perfect for beginners or occasional users alike.

All ingredients mixed quickly in this extra-large ice cream maker, and the add-ins were incorporated thoroughly. Keep in mind that this is a large machine that can be cumbersome, so it’s not meant for use in a standard kitchen with limited counter or sink space.

A freezer bowl ice cream maker, or canister-style, is one of the more popular styles for home use. This style utilizes a freezer bowl that must be frozen well in advance — sometimes up to eight hours in advance — so that all the ingredients are kept cold while churning. This style is easy to use and takes up relatively little space on the countertop, but remembering to freeze the bowl is an extra step that cannot be skipped. Freezer bowl ice cream makers are functional and yield great results, but typically, they’re best used for one batch at a time since the bowl needs to be frozen between each usage. Our best overall pick, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Chef'n Sweet Spot Ice Cream Maker</a>, is a freezer bowl-style ice cream maker.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another commonly-used ice cream maker model is the compressor style. These models don’t need to be frozen in advance. Instead, they begin chilling after the ice cream mixture is added. Compressor models are a bit more advanced than freezer bowl models and often include different features and functions specifically designed for making gelato or sorbet. This style is efficient and functional, and it’s particularly great for making multiple batches at once since you need to clean the parts between uses.&nbsp;The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cuisinart ICE-100</a> is our favorite compressor-style ice cream maker.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Price</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just like most kitchen appliances, ice cream makers vary greatly in price. We tested multiple products that ranged from $35 to $500, with an average price of $150. Since ice cream makers aren’t essential, most households will only use one occasionally. Before purchasing an ice cream maker, consider the price and how often you plan to use it. Cost is directly correlated to extra features, so if you’re looking for an advanced machine that is more automated, you can expect to pay more than a simple machine with basic functionality.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Additional Items Needed</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Do you need to pour a ton of ice into your ice cream maker for it to make the perfect sundae?

To start, we assembled each product according to the manufacturer’s instructions and took note of how intuitive or confusing the assembly and controls were. Next, we used each machine to churn a traditional, dairy-based ice cream batch. We timed how long the churning process took for each device and measured the amount of finished ice cream each machine produced. We cleaned each product and its accessories according to the manufacturer’s instructions and noted how easy the overall maintenance was.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Next, we tested each machine by whipping up a batch of fruit-based sorbet. We repeated the same steps and measured how much finished product each machine produced. After two hours in the freezer, we sampled both the dairy ice cream and the sorbet. When sampling, we assessed how easy each batch was to scoop with a standard scooper. We examined the consistency of each batch and paid special attention to how well the ice cream kept its shape. We observed how evenly our mix-ins were distributed, and tasted each product for flavor, consistency, and texture. We also set a batch of each ice cream in the freezer overnight and assessed the quality the next day to determine its ability to maintain freshness.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Russell Kilgore</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-86fb152d-7876-4492-a5b9-85e0ea09cb6f></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the difference between a compressor and an ice cream maker?</span></p><p>Unlike freezer bowl style ice cream makers — which need to be placed in the freezer for hours before use — compressor style ice cream makers have a built-in refrigeration system that chills the bowl automatically.

Depending on the type of model you buy, these machines can churn out sorbet and gelato too, and you can add your own flavorings or mix-ins.
