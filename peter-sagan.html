It requires a lot of training, unshakeable dedication, and will power of a beast.</p><p>Peter had all those since his early days; he would compete in races wearing just a t-shirt and sports shoes, no safety pads or anything. He would drink plain water during the race while the other racer drank sports drinks.</p><p>Peter would stand out from the crowd of the latest tech users with his simple attire. Beginning his journey from a humble beginning, Sagan is still as humble as a sage.</p><p>Sagan was born on the 26th of January, 1990. He was born the youngest child to his parents Lubomir and Helena.</p><p>He was born and raised in Zilina, Slovakia, along with his two brothers and one sister.</p><p>Both the parents worked in their small grocery store. A family of five was dependent on the small business; thus, it was hard for Peter and his siblings to grow up.</p><p>Peter Sagan was born in a small town in Eastern Europe. Growing up, most of his family members were interested in cycling. He was encouraged by his family to participate in races.</p><p>As a kid, Sagan preferred to stay out in nature rather than at the school with books. Peter began cycling when he was nine years old, inspired by this older brother Juraj Sagan.</p><p>Later, he joined a local club and began dominating the local events. But it wasn’t until he won the national premier junior championship of his country, Slovakia, that he gained significant exposure.</p><p>He won the title in 2009, with an 0ff-the-shelve bike he borrowed from his sister.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Take a look at this article about Julian Alaphilippe, a French cyclist who grew up riding the hills of Kenya >></a></strong></p><h2>Peter Sagan | Professional Career</h2><p>Following the exposure, he was approached by sponsors for deals. He finally began his professional cycling career backed by a sponsorship contract.</p><p>Sagan began his professional cycling career in 2009. The first team he joined was DuklaTrencin Merida, a Slovakian road cycling team founded in 2004.</p><p>Sagan did not last long in his first-team; only a few months in, he joined the Deceuninck–Quick-Step but did not get an alluring contrast. As a result, he did not sign a contract with them.</p><p>The following year, Sagan finally landed a notable contract for the first time; he made a two-year contract with the Liquigas-Doimo in 2010.</p><p>In the training and try-out sessions, he impressed the sponsors after destroying multiple mountain bikes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peter-Sagan1-e1636526440689.jpg><p>The same year, he competed in the Tour Down Under event, where he severely hurt his arms and thighs following a crash. But that was nothing but a mere scratch for the legend as he continued and finished the race despite his fresh injuries.</p><p>He competed in the 2010 Paris-Nice race, where he won the first and second stages but did not win the race.</p><p>Similarly, he also participated in the 2010 Tour of California, winning the fifth and sixth stages. He was also awarded the Points Jersey and Youth Competition, but he finished 8th overall on the leaderboard.</p><p>The year 2011 would mark his first-ever professional title win. Sagan won the Giro di Sardegna after winning the first, third, and fourth stage and the green jersey for the most points.</p><h2>Peter Sagan | Achievements</h2><p>It would undoubtedly be difficult for the young rising stars in the sport to match Sagan’s achievements in his career.</p><p>After winning his seventh green jersey for the most points in the Tour de France race as the best sprinter and his third World Championship title in a row, Sagan’s name is engraved in the sports history as the first to achieve such greatness.</p><p>No road cyclist has ever won the World Championship title three times in a row. In just a few years, Sagan became a road cyclist legend from a simple Slovak mountain biker.</p><p>Peter has done a bunch of crazy-impressive stuff during races. He once stopped to sign an autograph for a fan during a mountain stage. He has also crossed the finishing line riding backward.</p><p>In the 2010 Tour of California, he got the chance to wear the Young Rider jersey and the points jersey.</p><p>Peter Sagan won three stages at the 2011 Vuelta A Espana, Slovak National Championship, Giro de Sardegna, and Tour de Pologne.</p><p>Likewise,&nbsp;Sagan won five stages of the 2012 Tour of California along with the points jersey. He also won four stages at the 2012 Tour de Suisse.</p><p>Moreover, he also won the 2016 European Road Championship and the Tour of Flanders, and Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec.</p><p>Sagan returned to dominate the Slovak National Championship and bagged in the title. He also bagged in the Paris–Roubaix title that season.</p><p>Lastly, he won the Gent–Wevelgem as well. Peter won three stages at the Tour de France along with the points jersey.</p><p>In August 2020, Sagan did not win any stage of the Tour de France race and lost the points jersey. Similarly, he did not perform very well in other races as well.</p><p>But his losing streak came to an end after he won the Giro d’Italia.</p><p><strong><a href=#>You might want to read about the 15 most-watched sports events in the world >></a></strong></p><h2>Peter Sagan | Net Worth</h2><p>Indeed, that many professional titles wins made him a fortune.</p><p>Peter Sagan has an estimated net worth of $10 million, accredited to his pro cycling career. He earns 5 million euros per year which places him at the 2nd of the highest-paid cyclist. He shares the rank with Tajed Pogcar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peter-Sagan5-e1636526612154.jpg><p>Moreover, he is an official partner of the California-based sunglass company, 100%. The company specializes in downhill and motocross eyewear.</p><p>“When I’m not racing, I like spending some time on my mountain bike, and I’m a fan of downhill racing and motocross as well. So 100% was a natural choice for me,” said Sagan.</p><p><strong><a href=#>You might want to read about 12 of the fittest athlete in the world >></a></strong></p><h2>Peter Sagan | Wife and Kids</h2><p>Peter Sagan married Katarína Smolková on the 11th of November, 2015, but it did not last much longer. The couple had a fresh beginning and were so in love, residing in Monaco.</p><p>But the freshness did not last long as they got divorced in 2018. The divorce was made official on the 18th of July, 2018.</p><p>The Slovak racer announced his divorce via a Facebook post in the middle of the Tour de France race. The post also stated that the two would remain close as co-parents for their firstborn, Marlon.</p><p>The sweet couple was blessed with a son on the 25th of October, 2017.</p><p>Sagan wrote, and we quote,</p><p>“After a long and thoughtful discussion, Kate and I have come to the conclusion that we would be much better if we separated as a couple. We feel we should continue our lives as good friends, and we both agree it is the right decision.”</p><p>Having said that, the World Champion also emphasized his children’s security and privacy.&nbsp;</p><p>“I will not comment any further, and I would like to thank everybody in advance for respecting our privacy,” he lastly added.</p><p>Peter did not let down his morale and kept a high spirit during the race despite the breakup. He even won three stages at the Tour de France and the green jersey right after the divorce.</p><p>He also joked with Vincenzo Nibali, high-fiving him when he signaled for his team car.</p><h2>Peter Sagan | Trivia</h2><p>Sagan would often sneak out of his kindergarten class to find something more interesting to do. Later, the Slovak racer dropped out of high school to follow a career in pro-cycling in Italy.</p><p>The Tourminator is too friendly with his coach, Peter Zanicky; they go to the pub together and come up with celebratory salutes after a few pints of beer which Sagan adopts in the upcoming races.</p><p>Once Peter Zanicky challenged this pupil to an arm-wrestling match to encourage the athletes. Sagan was so much into it; he wanted to win it anyhow, so he went on full force.</p><p>Sagan ended up breaking Zanicky’s arm, according to his then-manager, Matej Vysna.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Peter-Sagan-e1636527001102.jpg><p>In one of Sagan’s early races, a junior mountain bike race, Sagan hit his knee against the frame and was crying at the start, standing instead of being on his bike.</p><p>The coach told him to buckle up and get back in the race. Peter Sagan won the race later.</p><p>Sagan avoids walking around in his home country of Slovakia as people recognize him instantly and corner him quickly. He also helped his sister open a salon in downtown Zilina, his hometown.</p><p>In July of 2021, Sagan announced that he is leaving the Bora-Hansgrohe after the 2021 season. He is still racing for the UCI World team Bora-Hansgrohe, but it will be interesting to see who signs him up next season.</p><h2>Social Media Links</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>: 1.9 million followers</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Facebook</a>: 1.6 million followers</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter</a>: 944.6k followers</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Is Peter Sagan the best cyclist in the world?</h3><p>He is probably the best; who else has won the world championship three times in a row and wore the Tour de France Green Jersey seven times.
