He stands at 6 feet 5 inches(196 cm) and weighs around 120 kg (265 lbs).</p><p>With years of training and running in the field, he has a well-built body and developed reflexes.</p><h2>Who is Jordan Cameron? What is his nationality?</h2><p>The former footballer who played tight end for the NFL, <strong>Jordan Cravens Cameron,</strong> was born and raised in Los Angeles, California.&nbsp;</p><p>His great-grandfather, grandfather, and father all had played professional sports in their prime.</p><p>Likewise, his great-grandfather, <strong>Archie Jones,</strong> was a professional track runner, while his grandfather,<strong> Jack Cravens,</strong> was a basketball player for the Houston Cougars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2008-1206-JordonCameron.jpg><p>On the same note, Cravens’s father played professional basketball in the late 1970s. Keeping the family tradition, the son of <strong>Stan</strong> and <strong>Cathy Cameron</strong>, Jordan, also got involved in sports.</p><p>Along with him, Jordan’s siblings, <strong>Brynn</strong> and <strong>Colby,</strong> also grew up loving sports and later pursued a legit career.</p><p>His sister Brynn played basketball for USC women’s basketball team, while his brother was an undrafted free agent in NFL.</p><p>Besides that, Brynn is well-known for being the ex-fiancé of Jordan’s friend Blake Griffin. Moreover, she is the mother of Griffin’s two kids, Ford and Finley.&nbsp;</p><p>The two had a slight falling out when news about Griffin dating model Kendall Jenner surfaced right after they broke up.</p><p>She accused Blake of stranding her and their children to date Jenner and filed a palimony lawsuit against him.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, Griffin reportedly paid<strong> $258,000</strong> a month in child support. However, Blake denied the claim saying it wasn’t the right amount. Likewise, Jordan is American by nationality, while his ethnicity is white.</p><p>For his education, Cameron went to Newbury Park High School, where he played football.</p><p>After his graduation, Jordan enrolled at the University of Southern California with much difficulty, which we will later discuss.</p><h2>What is Jordan Cameron’s net worth?- Salary, Income Estimation, And Contracts</h2><p>As of December 2023, the former tight end Jordan Cameron has an estimated net worth of more than<strong> $67 million</strong>. Even though he played for a short time, Cameron did play rigorously and earned a handsome amount from it.</p><p>After the NFL Draft pick, young Cameron signed a contract with Cleveland Brown worth <strong>$2.5 million</strong> in 2011.</p><p>Similarly, in 2012, his salary was raised to<strong> $465,000</strong> from the previous <strong>$375,000</strong>. In 2015, Jordan signed a contract with Miami Dolphins for <strong>$15 million,</strong> including<strong> a $1 million</strong> salary.</p><p>From the looks of it, Jordan had a bright career for him, but sadly it was cut off short. Nonetheless, the former player lives a comfortable life with his family and loved ones.</p><p>Cameron announced his decision to walk away from the NFL in an interview with ESPN.com’s Pat McManamon.</p><p>He said, “I started thinking about concussions too much. You can’t play football like that.”</p><h2>Who is Jordan Cameron Dating?- Personal Life, Married, and Kids</h2><p>Talking about Jordan’s personal life, there is not much except that he is in a relationship. Currently, 32-year-old Cameron is dating <strong>Elin Nordegren</strong>, the former wife of famous golfer Tiger Woods.</p><p>Elin was married to Woods from 2004 to 2010 and had two children; <strong>Charli</strong>, 11, and <strong>Sam,</strong> 12. They divorced back in 2009.</p><p>Since the two had kept their relationship a secret, not many knew about their affair. But looking at the facts, Jordan and Elin probably started dating after Elin’s divorce from Tiger.</p><p>She officially parted ways with Woods after finding his countless affairs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jordan-001.jpg><p>Other than that, the couple has kept their relationship strict and hidden from the media. Aside from that, the couple gave birth to their first child in October 2019. And no, they have not tied the knot.</p><p>Furthermore, Cameron has a ten-year-old son named <strong>Tristan</strong> from his former relationship. Till now, no one knows who Tristan’s mother is.</p><p>Also, after his retirement, Cameron said he did not want Tristan to play football.</p><p>As of recently, the couple lives in a stunning $49.5 million mansion in Florida with their kids. Their house has a great front yard and backyard.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jordan-Cameron-home.webp><p>Similarly, the house has a beautiful pool, fireplace, and a calming color tone.</p><p>They reside in a very secluded place and receive plenty of privacy for themselves and their family. Besides that, they also have a&nbsp; house in Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking with ESPN in 2017, he hoped his son did not follow in his footsteps and understood the sport’s danger early.</p><p>“Let’s be real here. Football is the greatest sport. I really believe that. It’s the most difficult. You learn the most about yourself in football. It’s a hard sport. You have to be very comfortable with being uncomfortable.”</p><p>He added how Tristan playing high school football was okay but did not want him to go professional as he did.</p><p>“I know what goes on and the hits you take. Everything past the high school level gets more serious, and it’s not as much, I would say, fun anymore after high school.”</p><h2>High School and College Years</h2><p>Since his whole family was into sports and even his brother, Colby, was a budding footballer, Jordan took the sport seriously.</p><p>With support and determination, young Jordan made it into his school’s Newbury Park High School football team. Maybe it was his genes, but Cameron played exceptionally well from the beginning.</p><p>Thanks to that, Cameron made it into the ‘All-Marmonte League’ first team as a junior. During his senior year, he got into the ‘Prep Star All-West team and the ‘All-Marmonte League first team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jordan.jpg><p>Jordan played a wide receiver in his school days, scoring 12 touchdowns, and caught 73 passes for 1022 yards.</p><p>Despite being approached by many colleges, including Yale, Harvard, and USC, Cameron rejected the offer as he also played volleyball and basketball.</p><p>Since he was more into basketball, Cameron joined <strong>Brigham Young University</strong> to make it into the college’s team.</p><p>However, Utah’s coach<strong> Kyle Wittingham</strong> saw Cameron’s potential as a footballer rather than a basketball player and approached his family to persuade him.</p><p>After talking with his family and being redshirted by the college team ‘Cougars’ coach, Cameron immediately jumped into the offer from USC and transferred to the USC football team.</p><p>Upon his involvement, Jordan began playing as a wide receiver, but following his former college’s credit-transfer issues, he was compelled to join Ventura College.</p><p>Because of it, Jordan missed playing football that year and has to rejoin again the next year.</p><p>Sadly, his return to the USC team was not celebrated as he failed to score any catches. Later, his coach realized Jordan’s potential as a tight end rather than a wide receiver.</p><p>Thanks to that, Cameron caught 16 passes for 126 yards in his final season and had one successful touchdown.</p><h2>Professional Career in NFL</h2><p>Following his impressive season end and college graduation, Jordan was invited to play at the East-West Shrine game, where he impressed coaches from many teams.</p><p>Even though he was not in a lot of demand, Jordan improved his chances during the NFL Combine. By the end of the drill, Cameron ended up in the top three.</p><p>Likewise, as expected, in the 2011 NFL Draft, Cleveland Browns picked him as the 102nd pick. For the next two years, Jordan played exceptionally well and, in December 2013, was voted for the Pro Bowl.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jordan-003.jpg><p>By the start of 2015, Jordan moved to Miami Dolphins and signed a <strong>$15 million</strong> contract with them. Sadly, his career did not take off as expected, as he was placed on injured reserve in November soon after his move.</p><p>He suffered from multiple concussions, a total of four in six seasons, and hence, on March 10, 2017, Jordan Cameron officially retired from the NFL.</p><p>Of course, Cameron did like ending his flourishing football career as soon he turned 28. He addressed the issue with a heartfelt message.</p><p>“If I didn’t get concussions, I’d probably keep playing. It’s one of those things. I can’t risk my mental health in the future. I don’t have any symptoms now, I’s perfectly fine. But they can’t tell me with 100% certainty that if I keep playing and I get more concussions, that I’m going to be OK.”</p><p>Talking with ESPN in 2017, Cameron then added,</p><p>“I’m not risking that at all. There’s nothing more than your health. It’s just not worth it to me.”</p><p>Moreover, he also added how he wanted to avoid having a mental disorder or depression. He said that he wanted to be there for his family.</p><p>Despite his early retirement, in just 66 games, Cameron made an impressive record; 173 catches for 2,046 yards, followed by 14 touchdowns.</p><h2>Stats</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Stats-Jordan.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Career-Scoring-by-Jordan.jpg><h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQS)</h2><h3>Was Jordan Cameron in Glasgow Sheriff’s Court?</h3><p>No, it was a different person with the same name who police officials booked on two charges of housebreaking.&nbsp;</p><h3>Was Jordan Cameron captain of the Leicester Tigers?</h3><p>No, Jordan was not the captain of the Leicester Tigers.
