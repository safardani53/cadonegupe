Run to the highest ground possible."</p><p>Government spokesperson, Hayashi Yoshimasa, warned it was critical for people in coastal areas to get away from the oncoming tsunami waves.</p><p>He said: "Every minute counts. Please evacuate to a safe area immediately."</p><p>Around 33,500 households around the epicentre, in Toyama, Ishikawa and Niigata prefectures, were without power, local utilities said.</p><p>Panic buying has broken out in the stores across the affected areas as residents stock up on water, rice and bread.</p><p>The country's nuclear authority said that <a href=#>nuclear plants</a> in the area had not reported any irregularities and there was no risk of radioactive leaks.</p><p>An elderly man told broadcaster NHK: "I have never experienced anything like this before, it was scary.
