And three of the four Warner brothers missed the premiere because their brother Sam had just passed away.”</p><h2>THE NEW NORMAL?</h2><p>Fans were impressed by Jesse's comeback as he went from third place to first, but other Reddit users expressed feeling streak-starved, leading to a debate about what's happening here.</p><p>One applauded: "Jesse missed two Daily Doubles, but that didn't discourage him from rebuilding. That's quite impressive!"</p><p>Another agreed: "Jesse had some bad luck with daily doubles, but he made it work out in the end."</p><p>A third remarked: "This has been a week of low Final Jeopardy winnings and lots of new winners who don't stay long on the show!"</p><p>And a fourth: "Contestants are 1 for 9 in Final Jeopardy this week. It wouldn't surprise me to see the writers lob a 'States Ending In Hampshire.'"</p><p>"I feel like ratings are going to drop if the show keeps up this way," a fifth wrote.</p><p>A sixth even said: "Man, I would have killed these players. None of these people and the people of the last few weeks ever go big. Woo hoo. The winner has like $2k. lol."</p><p>Another Redditor worried: "Even though Season 38 and the first half of Season 39 had a lot of five-time champs and 10+ time champs, things had to slow down eventually.</p><p>"But it's unlikely to last for that long. Sometimes you just gotta go with the flow and enjoy the trivia. Well, except for the clues that end up being <a href=#>poorly written</a>, but still..."</p><p>Another wrote: "I believe the large number of super champs in season 38 had a lot to do with Covid, and the effect travel restrictions had on the contestant talent pool. What we're seeing now (with so many 1-/2-day champs) is a return to the normal pattern of competitive matches between intensely screened players."</p><p>A third defended: "You think exciting, down-to-the-wire matches where all three contestants end Double Jeopardy above $10,000 are bad for ratings?"</p><p>A fourth claimed: "If Ben Chan had kept playing, I think there's a very good chance he would have been an 11-day champ by now."</p><h2>STREAK OF NO STREAKS</h2><p>There hasn't been a four-day winner on Jeopardy! since&nbsp;<a href=#>Stephen Webb's eight-day streak ended on March 16</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Ben Chan bowed out after his third runaway win</a>, he did not compete on Monday, April 14 as scheduled, concerning fans- as he seemed like he was going to break the curse.</p><p>In a rare occurrence,&nbsp;<a href=#>there were three new contestants</a>&nbsp;instead and Ben will be returning to go for win four as the returning champ (<a href=#>of two</a>&nbsp;out of a technicality) on May 15's episode.</p><p>As for Ben, he later clarified&nbsp;<a href=#>the real reason he did not return as scheduled</a>.</p><p>“Before yesterday’s episode taped, I had tested positive for COVID; it was a very mild case, as you can see, I’m fine.</p><p>"Most importantly, my buzzer finger is fine, so I’m excited to watch what happens over the next few weeks, see who I’ll be competing against on May 15," he said during a virtual appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Day Wisconsin</a>.</p><p>One fan responded when he tweeted out the story: "Looking forward to your return!"</p><p>The other three-day champ in the past month was <a href=#>Brian Hennegar</a>, but otherwise,<a href=#> Jeopardy!</a> has been a carousel of one or two-day winners and low scores.</p><p>In one rarity,<a href=#> 1-day winner Devin Lohman won with $1.2K,</a> the lowest amount of the season after a triple stumper wiped everyone's scores.</p><p>He ended up with less takeaway than the contestant in second place's $2K consolation prize.</p><p>For reference, this time last year super-champion <a href=#>Mattea Roach</a> was in the midst of their 23-game winning streak.</p><p>Then came Ryan Long - and before them Amy Schneider and Matt Amodio, all during one deeply impressive season.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ken is hosting his final week of the season this week - <a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a> will return on May 1 and helm the last four months of the season.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>While she is doing so Ken will host&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeopardy!
