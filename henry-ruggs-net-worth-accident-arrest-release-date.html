Earlier this year, on May 10, he had pleaded guilty to one count of DUI causing death and misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter.</strong></p><p>The athlete and his girlfriend were involved in a car accident two years before, on November 2, 2021.</p><p>Ruggs and his girlfriend sustained some minor injuries, but the crash resulted in the death of a young girl and her dog.</p><p>With recent sentencing, it has been almost sure that the first-round pick of the 2020 NFL draft has lost hope of redeeming his football career.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Former-Las-Vegas-WR-Henry-Ruggs-III-e1691649199862.jpg><p>Henry James Ruggs III, better known as <a href=#>Henry Ruggs</a>, began his professional career in 2020. The Las Vegas Raiders chose him as the 12th overall pick in the draft.&nbsp;</p><p>Ruggs was the fastest runner to cover the 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine that year. In addition, he became the fourth-fastest runner to cover that distance since electronic timing started in 1999.</p><p>He had an exceptional rookie season despite missing some games because of Covid restrictions. Henry recorded 26 receptions and two touchdowns while covering 452 receiving yards in 13 games.</p><h2>Henry Ruggs Net Worth&nbsp;</h2><p>During his arrest, the former NFL wide receiver Henry Ruggs III had an estimated net worth of<strong> $5 million.</strong></p><p>Although the player or any other media never spoke about it, his contract details and salary amounts suggest it is true.</p><p>After Las Vegas picked him in the draft, Henry signed a four-year contract worth $16.67 million on July 21, 2020. Even though his salary that season was around $600k, he received over $9 million as his signing bonus.</p><p>The following year, he played seven games and earned about $607k before his career ended because of the tragic accident.</p><p>Later that same day, the Las Vegas Raiders announced his release and informed the media that his contract had been terminated.</p><p>Besides, the athlete earned more money through brand deals and endorsements. He partnered with Three Square, a food bank based in southern Nevada, in April 2020.</p><h2>More On His Accident And Subsequent Deaths</h2><p>On November 2, 2021, at around 3:39 am, Henry Ruggs and his longtime girlfriend, <a href=#>Kiara Je’Nai Kilgo-Washington</a>, slammed their car into another car, causing two deaths on the spot, including a dog.</p><p>Just some hours before the accident, the media had spotted them drinking alcohol at Las Vegas Strip in Paradise.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Tina-Tintor-And-Her-Dog-Max-Both-Of-Whom-Died-After-The-Crash-e1691655684599.jpg><p>According to police, the athlete was driving his Chevrolet Corvette, which he had nicknamed Lizzy, at around 156 miles per hour when he suddenly saw another car in front.&nbsp;</p><p>Although he tried to stop his car at the last hour, it had already become late. Twenty-three-year-old <a href=#>Tina Tintor</a> and her dog, Max, burned to death after her car burst into flames immediately after the collision.</p><h3>Arrest, Charges, And Release Date</h3><p>The Las Vegas Metropolitan PD had initially charged Henry with reckless driving and DUI resulting in death.</p><p>Immediately after his release from hospital, the police transferred him to Clark County Detention Center. The following day, he was released on a bail of $150k.</p><p>Almost two years later, he pleaded guilty to the charges pressed against him in May. On August 9, 2023, the court in Las Vegas sentenced him to spend three to ten years in prison.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Henry-Ruggs-During-His-Court-Hearing-On-August-9-e1691655403636.jpg><p>Standing before the audience in court, Henry apologized to the deceased’s family and admitted that he committed a huge mistake.</p><p>Tintor’s mother, Mirjana Komazec, said that nothing like that should happen to anyone’s family and wished the best for Henry and his daughter.</p><p>She added, “And we pray this terrible accident inspires positive change in the world. We pray that we all take away the importance of looking out for one another, remembering everyone we meet is another human’s loved one.”</p><p>Consequently, it has been confirmed that he will not be released soon. The athlete accepts that he has no excuses and wishes to teach others about the dangers of unsafe driving after his release from prison.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC0xKepsmWiqrSov4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMmpqcoZSau7V5wKupnqukYr%2BmuMSaqp5llJbBpns%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jenelle-evans-reflects-on-bad-boyfriends-and-rough-relationships.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jenelle Evans Reflects on &amp;quot;Bad Boyfriends &amp;amp; Rough Relationships&amp;quot; For MTV Special">&larr;
