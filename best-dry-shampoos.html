From there, we spritzed our hair, let the dry shampoo set, and brushed it through to see how well the sprays absorbed oil and added volume to our roots. We also assessed how well the sprays brushed into our strands for a silky-smooth feel with no visible residue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though 20 were put to the test, only these 8 were able to give us red carpet-ready hair.

We loved the cooling sensation left after application and were wowed by the volume it delivered to limp roots. Several of us agreed that we were impressed with its super-absorbency without drying out our scalps, which is vital for natural hair textures.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's worth noting that the dry shampoo dispersed wet, and came out with a white cast. But after waiting about two minutes to dry down and massaging through, the product all but disappeared and sucked away oils. No trace was left but a cheerful, clean scent and refreshed feeling. It can be easy for extra products like dry shampoo to make your hair feel dense or powdery, but with this one, our hair felt just like normal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only caveats could be the extended wait time and initial chalky white cast, which could prove problematic for those in a rush or with very dark hair. All in all, Klorane was the fave for its powerful buildup removal and lightweight revitalization.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Aerosol |<strong> Size:</strong> 3.2 oz. | <strong>Scent: </strong>Floral</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tara Donne</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-anomaly-dry-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Anomaly Dry Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Anomaly Dry Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/7h6vDah5rTBVsTP1dJJttFsKvUY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/anomaly-dry-shampoo-363e4b4e811d4aa6a943878b501f87e3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Even those of us with thin hair saw an incredible boost of volume in our tresses</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The spray consists of a clear formula that does not leave a white cast or residue</p></li><li readability=0><p>Since it comes in an aluminum can, this dry shampoo is recyclable</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester quickly fell in love with this dry shampoo from Anomaly thanks to its volume-boosting benefits, noting how her thin hair had never experienced this much volume before. She was shocked to see a product lift her hair up so much while still looking and feeling natural.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And in terms of oil absorption? Our tests revealed it worked well in that department, too, allowing the hair to feel dry and oil-free, without that dreaded "crispiness" that some dry shampoos leave. With all of the above in mind, the around-$8 price point seems like a steal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Aerosol |<strong> Size:</strong> 5 oz. | <strong>Scent: </strong>Light</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tamara Staples</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-oribe-gold-lust-dry-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Oribe Gold Lust Dry Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Oribe Gold Lust Dry Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/JcGjKEf-ABucbz0RgfN59esdsz0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/oribe-gold-lust-dry-shampoo-5f030d26ee1141adbe6758bb4117532a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=1><p>It's made with Oribe's signature scent, Côte d'Azur, which doubles as a luxurious perfume</p></li><li readability=0><p>The absorbent formula lifted our hair at the root, adding an extra dose of volume</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The light powder provided a soft and silky feel to our strands</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking to add a little bit of luxury to your beauty lineup, invest in this weightless wonder to skip a wash and feel like you just left the salon. Reviewers were struck by the luxe feeling straight out of the can, noting that the formula wet their tresses, but dried away quickly. After the dry shampoo was brushed out, hair felt soft and silky, notably infused with the signature scent of this haircare brand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Testers swooned over the oomph the Oribe spray delivered, noting how it looks, feels, and smells luxurious. The brand's signature scent, Côte d'Azur, was developed in collaboration with one of the oldest French fragrance houses — and features notes of Calabrian bergamot, white butterfly jasmine, and sandalwood. However, it may not be ideal for those who are sensitive to strong, perfume-heavy smells. In the end, it comes down to personal preference whether the robust aroma would create a good or bad hair day – and if the price is worth it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's worth noting that while it is the most expensive option on the list, it's also the option with the highest volume of product, so it will definitely last you a while, even if you do use dry shampoo often. If you want to get the look and channel your inner Hollywood goddess for less, though, try the more affordable travel size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Aerosol |<strong> Size:</strong> 6.3 oz. | <strong>Scent: </strong>Oribe's signature scent, Côte d'Azur</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tara Donne</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-light-hair-moroccanoil-dry-shampoo-light-tones></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Light Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Moroccanoil Dry Shampoo Light Tones</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Moroccanoil Dry Shampoo Light Tones" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ur__9cGSMmDdMUY8hVLOEE_U-a0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/moroccanoil-dry-shampoo-light-tones-f022f19e75f84c8cac168371d22b343a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>Its refreshing formula absorbed our natural oils and dried down almost immediately</p></li><li readability=0><p>We liked the clean, fresh scent that our strands were left with after a few quick spritzes</p></li><li readability=1><p>This spray left no trace of chalkiness at our roots, which we love for rushed mornings or a quick touch-up</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After three days of not washing her hair, our blonde tester used this Moroccanoil dry shampoo and was impressed with the result. "[The dry shampoo] took a pea-sized amount of coconut oil out of my hair, so it put in work," she says. "I don't feel oily at all." She rated this "10/10 for absorbing oil," which really is the most you can ask for in a dry shampoo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On top of that, she was elated that the spray comes out purple — and left an "icy" look on her bleach-blonde hair. "I'm elated every time a blonde-specific product makes my hair look icier or purple, blue, or pink," she notes. "I don't know if every bleach blonde would want this feature, but, personally, I am obsessed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Aerosol |<strong> Size:</strong> 3.2 oz. | <strong>Scent: </strong>Clean</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dark-hair-billie-floof-dry-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Dark Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Billie Floof Dry Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Billie Floof Dry Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/gkdf3pHKBdYFHmAAVbVSbg2iIvc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/billie-floof-dry-shampoo-498d7907cd5b4cfc807769313af1b968.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mybillie</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>This shake-out powder absorbed our oil without leaving a chalky residue in our hair</p></li><li readability=0><p>To our surprise, it had a clean scent that made our hair feel fresher</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The brown powder blended in nicely on those of us with darker strands</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>Using too much product could cause buildup and weigh down your hair</p></li><li readability=0><p>It had a slightly gritty texture, which was very different from the others we tried</p></li><li readability=1><p>You have to be a little careful with how you apply this powder, because the brown shade can temporarily stain your hands</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're a brunette that prefers a powder dry shampoo over an aerosol, we recommend Billie's Floof Dry Shampoo.

We also found that if you add too much powder it could weigh the hair down, so you need to make sure to use the right amount for your hair type to reap its benefits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One tester even said she never thought she would love a powder dry shampoo, but this product converted her.

However, because this dry shampoo was super effective at absorbing oil and added some volume at the root, too, we think it's well worth the price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Powder |<strong> Size:</strong> 2 oz. | <strong>Scent: </strong>Light</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tamara Staples</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-nourishing-ogx-extra-strength-refresh--restore-coconut-miracle-oil-dry-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Nourishing</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>OGX Extra Strength Refresh + Restore Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="OGX Extra Strength Refresh &amp;amp; Restore + Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/k2w-dA-mFsO2l0Cc-PK82e8FPd4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/OGX-Extra-Strength-Refresh--Restore--Coconut-Miracle-Oil-Dry-Shampoo-1909668e42054b4dbc1e0af2d41d0e42.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=0><p>This product felt incredibly nourishing in our hair, freshening up our hair without drying it out</p></li><li readability=0><p>It has a fairly low price tag, which we appreciated</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The addition of coconut oil helped tame our frizz and make our strands look a little sleeker</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What makes this OGX dry shampoo stand out from the pack is the added coconut oil, which isn't common in dry shampoos. Adding an oil-based product to oily hair may seem like a disaster waiting to happen, but it ended up being the opposite. Our tester's hair felt healthy while looking cleaner than before after using this dry shampoo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Instead of drying out your hair as some dry shampoos can do, it is meant to absorb the resting oil on your hair and replace it with nourishing coconut oil, an ingredient that is great for taming frizz and sealing in moisture. Our testers said that while their hair still felt a bit oily (which makes sense, as there is oil in the formula), it didn't look it at all, with one even saying it performed the best out of all the dry shampoos she tested — which is quite a testament for such a budget-friendly product. Our tests showed it worked especially well for those with thinner hair and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curly hair</a>, thanks to the volume boost and frizz control.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Aerosol |<strong> Size:</strong> 5 oz. | <strong>Scent: </strong>Vanilla</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-dry-shampoo></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying Dry Shampoo</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Hair Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Look in the mirror and assess your tresses — what are you working with?

Aerosols use alcohol-based formulas to absorb oil from the scalp and add volume to the hair, while powders use starch-based formulas. Powder products typically last longer than aerosol sprays, which could save you money if you use a lot of dry shampoo, while aerosol formulas may be better for styling (and are typically easier to apply). In the end, it all comes down to personal preference: what ingredients you want to add to your scalp and how you typically style your hair.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.91944444444444><p><span class=accordion__title>Is expensive dry shampoo worth it?</span></p><p><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Oribe's Gold Lust Dry Shampoo</a> is by far the most expensive option on our list, and we can back up its benefits from absorption power to the infamous luxurious scent.

This is why it can cause irritation to the scalp if used too often without being cleansed properly. It is recommended to wash hair with shampoo and water a few times a week depending on your hair needs.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Erika Reals</a> is the Senior Shopping Editor at PEOPLE.com covering beauty, style, home, and lifestyle topics.
