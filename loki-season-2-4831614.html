The show was a huge hit and was renewed for a second season, which will premiere on October 6. Loki&nbsp;follows the God of Mischief, played by&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong></a>, after the events of&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame&nbsp;where an alternate version of Loki from 2012 stole the Tesseract and created a new timeline. Season 1 dove deep into the idea of the multiverse, and season 2 is going even deeper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Loki-Season-2-Updates-Disney-embed-5.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The official season 2 trailer was released on July 31. Loki finds himself “timeslipping” between the past and present. “If what I saw is true, there is nothing that stands between this world and utter destruction,” he says. Brace yourselves, Loki season 2 is going to be one thrilling ride. We’ve rounded up everything you need to know about Loki&nbsp;season 2, including the cast, release date, and much more.</p><h2>Where Did Loki Season 2 Film?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Filming for&nbsp;Loki&nbsp;season 2 began on June 13, 2022, at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom. In July 2022, the cast was spotted at the Chatham Historic Dockyard in Kent, England. The following month, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on-set photos</a> showed Tom Hiddleston filming with <strong>Sophia Di Martino</strong>, who plays an alternate version of Loki named Sylvie. Filming on season 2 concluded in October 2022.</p><h2>When Will Loki Season 2 Come Out?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Loki season 2 premieres October 6 on Disney+. The season will consist of six episodes just like season 1 that will be released weekly. The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>premiere date</a> was announced by Marvel Studios President <strong>Kevin Feige</strong> at Disney Upfronts in New York on May 16.</p><h2>Who is in the Cast for Season 2?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>The following cast members appeared in&nbsp;Loki&nbsp;season 1 and are confirmed to be returning for season 2.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Loki-Season-2-Updates-Disney-embed-3.jpg><ul><li><strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong> as Loki</li><li><strong>Sophia Di Martino</strong> as Sylvie.</li><li><strong>Gugu Mbatha Raw</strong> as Ravonna Renslayer, a former Minuteman for the Time Variance Authority (TVA) who rose to the rank of judge.</li><li><strong>Eugene Cordero&nbsp;</strong>as Casey/Hunter K-5E, a TVA employee.</li><li><strong>Tara Strong</strong> as Miss Minutes, the animated clock mascot of the TVA.</li><li><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Owen Wilson</strong></a> as Mobius M.

It’s possible he could be the new villain.&nbsp;<strong>Wunmi&nbsp;Mosaku&nbsp;</strong>is expected to return as TVA agent Hunter B-15. It’s unclear if <strong>Richard E. Grant</strong>, who plays an elderly variant of Loki named “Classic Loki,” will be back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Loki-Season-2-Updates-Disney-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jonathan Majors</strong></a> will be reprising his role as one of the variants of the villain Kang the Conqueror. Jonathan is currently <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>facing domestic abuse charges</a>, which he has <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>denied</a>. It’s currently unclear how Marvel will handle the controversy moving forward.</p><h2>Who is the Creative Team Behind Season 2?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Kate Herron</strong>, the showrunner and lead director for&nbsp;Loki&nbsp;season 1, isn’t returning for season 2. “I would say that when I joined Loki, it was always going to be those six episodes,” she told <a class=body-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/loki-episode-6-ending-kate-herron-alternate-scenes-1234984129/ data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a> about her&nbsp;departure from the show in July 2021. “We were treating it like a movie, and we were running it like a movie. We weren’t doing it in the showrunner system. So it was a lot to direct these six episodes, and I gave it all of my energy and everything I had in my soul and in my heart. I threw everything I loved about Marvel at it.&nbsp;So I just feel like my part is done, but I’m really excited to see where it’s going to go next,” she added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Season 1 head writer<strong> Michael Waldron&nbsp;</strong>has signed on to executive produce the second season.&nbsp;<strong>Eric Martin&nbsp;</strong>will serve as the head writer while <strong>Justin Benson</strong> and <strong>Aaron Moorhead&nbsp;</strong>will lead the directing team following their work on the Marvel series&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Moon Knight</a>.</p><h2>Loki Season 2 Plot: What Will Happen?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Loki-Season-2-Updates-Disney-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>The second season of&nbsp;Loki&nbsp;is expected to pick up after the events of the season one finale, where Loki ends up at TVA headquarters and comes across Mobius and Hunter B-15, who have no idea who he is. Loki also sees a huge statue of He Who Remains at the center of the library instead of the statue of the Time Keepers. This is after Sylvie kills He Who Remains, which unleashes a multiverse with alternate timelines that the TVA cannot control.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>In the season 2 trailer, Loki and Mobius team up to figure out the answers to their questions and save the world. “It’s up to us to save this place,” Loki says. He also fears “war is on its way.” A variant of Kang the Conqueror is seen in the trailer, picking up where <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania</a> left off.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>The overall plot of Loki&nbsp;season 2 has been kept under wraps, as is the case for all Marvel projects. The first footage of the new season was shown at the D23 Expo in September 2022. It shows Loki talking to Mobius in a callback scene to season 1, but this time Mobius doesn’t know who he is since the timeline was disrupted (per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Direct).&nbsp;</a>Loki tells Mobius he doesn’t want to be “the bad guy,” and when Mobius asks who thinks of him that way, Loki drops the names of some notable MCU characters. “Iron Man. Captain America. Hulk. Black Widow. Hawkeye. Phil Coulson. Thanos. Nick Fury. My father. My brother. Miss Minutes. You,” Loki says to Mobius in the footage.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Some of the cast and crew of Loki&nbsp;have dropped some hints about the next season. <strong>Michael Waldron</strong> previously told<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;Deadline</a>, “It felt like we had new emotional ground to cover with Loki. That’s the only way into season two. We absolutely found that. It’s a great continuation of that story that feels different from season one and hopefully will subvert expectations.” He also teased a return from Kang, saying, “In creating the show in the first place, the only way it’s worth doing to me is that we can find a new story to tell with this character.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Loki-Season-2-Updates-Disney-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15><strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong> previously spoke about season 2 in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Total Film</a>. “What can I say? It’s very much continuing to excite and challenge me. At the end of season 1, the story isn’t over. I think that’s really clear,” the British actor said. “Loki’s almost more unstable, and as turbulent and passionate and chaotic as he’s ever been. And maybe some of that needs resolution. There’s stuff to unpack.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16><strong>Gugu Mbatha-Raw</strong> also teased what’s to come for her character, Ravonna Renslayer. “I feel like there’s so much potential, especially when you’re dealing with time, as Renslayer does, you know?” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Digital Spy</a>&nbsp;before season 2 filming began. “I sort of keep an open mind. I’m sort of open to the next chapter. We’ll see. I would, of course, be open to (a movie). I don’t know where it’s all going at this point, but we’ll see.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Loki fans have speculated that at least one episode in season 2 will take place during the 1970s. That’s because there were <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>set photos that leaked</a> of Loki and Agent Mobius dressed in tuxedos in a 70s setting. Time travel and the multiverse will definitely keep being a major factor in the next season.&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>will continue to keep you updated on&nbsp;Loki&nbsp;season 2 right here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8uooqJlo5qutLvNZmlmbGhofnd9k2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./todd-chrisley-julie-chrisleys-relationship-timeline.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Todd Chrisley, Julie Chrisley's Relationship Timeline">&larr;
