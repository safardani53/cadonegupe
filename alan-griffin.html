Nonetheless, he played in Italy for teams like Cordivari Roseto in 1998.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Audrey-Griffin.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Shortly after, he started his career with Boston Celtics in 1999. After that, Adrian would represent Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets, and Chicago Bulls.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>O</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>n February 21, 2008, he was traded to Seattle SuperSonics as an 11-player deal. It also involved players from Cleveland Cavaliers, Chicago Bulls, and SuperSonics.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly, Adrian was traded again to the Milwaukee Bucks on August 13, 2008. Shortly after the 2007-08 season, he retired in 2009.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After his retirement, Adrian started working as a coaching assistant.&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He has coached for Orlando Magic, Milwaukee Bucks, Chicago Bulls, and the Oklahoma City Thunder.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Moreover, he has been serving as the assistant coach for the Raptors since 2018.</p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Mother</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Audrey Griffin, the mother of Alan Griffin, is a blogger and author by profession.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She is the author of “The Day I Tool Off My Cape,” a contemporary parenting book.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She is also a lifestyle parenting blogger for a popular parenting site known as “Removing the Cape.” Audrey’s blogs address issues concerning child-rearing, parenting, marriage, and sex.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, Audrey is the former Vice President of ‘Behind the Bench,’ a National Basketball Wives Association.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Alan Griffin’s </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Parents Divorce</span></h3><p>As stated, Alan’s parents’ love life was not precisely cookies and creams. <span data-preserver-spaces=true>The two are now divorced; his mother, Audrey, accused Adrian of physical and emotional abuse.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Additionally, Audrey revealed that her husband refused to follow a court order to pay child support.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Adrian stated they are involved in a </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>longstanding legal dispute over alimony and child support arrangements.</span></p><h2>Professional Career&nbsp;</h2><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>High School Highlights&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Young Alan attended Oak Park and River Forest High School in Oak Park, Illinois. Later, he moved to Ossining High School in Ossining, New York. There he played alongside <a href=# rel=noopener>Obi Toppin</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Alan transferred to Archbishop Stepinac High School for his final two years. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As a senior, Alan recorded 9.9 rebounds per game, 19.2 points, and shot 48 percent from the three-point range.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He led his high school team to the New York State Federation Class A.A. title. Besides, he contributed to Stepinac’s winning of Class A.A. and Catholic High School Athletic Association Archdiocesan titles.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, Griffin was named player of Putnam County and Westchester Country player by The Journal News.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>College Stats&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Griffin chose Illinois over Iona, Fordham, and La Salle, and in his first year, averaged 2.8 points in 8.1 minutes per game.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Alan became the team’s sixth man as a sophomore but was suspended for two games on January 23, 2020.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It was after he stepped on Sasha Stefanovic’s chest, who was an opposing guard of Purdue.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Despite this, Alan recorded a season-high six three-pointers and 24 points in a 74-66 win against Northwestern. Additionally, he went on to average 4.5 rebounds and 8.9 points per game.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illinois-Alan-Griffin-0-shoots-as-Northwesterns-Pat-Spencer-12-defends-in-the-first-half-of-an-NCAA-college-basketball-game-1-1024x683.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After his transfer to Syracuse</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, </span>Griffin filled out paperwork with the NCAA to grant him immediate eligibility and got approved by Syracuse Athletics for the 2020-21 season.&nbsp;</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>During his first five games at Syracuse, Alan averaged 18.4 points per game. He led Syracuse, further tallying 23, 20, and 22 points against Rider, Rutgers, and Boson College.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, on December 16, 2020, Alan finished a game scoreless against Northeastern.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He made a massive comeback against Buffalo on December 19, 2020, recording ten rebounds, 24 points, two steals, three assists, and three blocks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, his involvement in the match sent the game into overtime. It eventually led Syracuse to an 11-point victory.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Following the season, he declared for the 2021 NBA Draft but went undrafted and joined Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA-G league.</p><p>However, he was waived on December 14 after 4 games, and Griffin signed with the Westchester Knicks on December 19, 2021.</p><p>After being waved, he signed with the Newfoundland Growlers of the CEBL on May 18, 2022.</p><p>Alan Griffin played only three games with the CEBL team in the 2022 season. He is an active roster of Growlers for the 2023 CEBL season.</p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What Does Alan Griffin’s Eligibility Mean For Syracuse?</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After his eligibility, Alan looked forward to strengthening the team’s starting roster. He transferred to Syracuse after scoring nine points per game last season with Illinois.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Further, the team was concerned about who would fit the small forward position before Alan was deemed eligible. It led to Quincy Guerrier’s recognition as an option despite his lack of range and offensive skills.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, Syracuse believed Quincy would provide support for rebounds.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Illinois-guard-Alan-Griffin-0-drives-around-Michigan-State-forward-Aaron-Henry-11-during-a-game-in-January.-1024x682.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly to last season, the team spaced out Girard, Boeheim, and Griffin. The lineup was considered perfect along the three-point line, with Bourama Sidibe and Marek Dolezaj in the down-low.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Three A’s: A Trio Of Division Prodigy</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Many siblings, such as the Lopez twins, have established themselves in the pro ranks in the league (<a href=# rel=noopener>Brook</a> & Robin).</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Morris twins (Markieff & Marcus) and Ball brothers (<a href=# rel=noopener>LiAngelo</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Lonzo</a> & LaMelo) are perfect examples.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>They have made a statement and left a mark on the basketball scene for the last few years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Griffin trio comes from the Griffin family, with three basketball-playing kids. The family has been together in Ossining, New York, for a few decades.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Like Alan, the Griffin family has two other members (Aubrey & Adrian Jr.) actively participating in basketball.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Aubrey Griffin</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Aubrey is the sibling of Allan Griffin, who plays for Ossining High School. She was part of the powerhouse program under head coach Dan Ricci.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Aubrey Griffin led her team to a sectional title and recorded 8.7 rebounds, 28.3 points, and 3.2 steals per game, winning the Section 1 Miss Basketball Award.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The award is among the highest honor given to the best female player in Westchester County.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, Aubrey reached the 1,000-point milestone during her freshman year. She</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> was a sophomore in the powerhouse women’s basketball team at the University of Connecticut (2020-21).&nbsp;</span></p><p>As a Junior for the 2021-22 season, Aubrey did not play due to injury.</p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Adrian Jr. Griffin</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Stepinac’s freshman is a younger sibling of Alan, who has high motor skills and is explosive in the game. His performance on the court makes him a candidate for the top players in his class.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/img_0599.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He recorded 11.6 points per game and was the third-leading scorer for the team’s Crusaders.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Besides, he was one of the top 10 recruits in the 2021 class and committed himself to Duke.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Age, Height & Weight</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Alan Griffin is 23 years of age. He has a muscular physique, ideal for playing the forward position in basketball.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For those curious, young Griffin stands at 1.96 m and weighs around 190 lb. Likewise, he has a wingspan of 84 inches.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Alan is a good shooter despite his immense build and scoring mid-range. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Due to his physical attributes, the American-born has decent rebounding skills too.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Net Worth & Dating</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Alan has signed with the Newfoundland Growlers of the CEBL but is&nbsp;yet to leave a mark.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, Griffin’s net worth is around $1 million as of 2024. Most of his income came from his previous contracts with NBA teams.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nonetheless, as the son of the former basketball star Adrian Griffin, Alan lives a comfortable and lavish lifestyle.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Because of his impressive collegiate performance with Fighting Illini and Syracuse, he got rather smaller deals.</p><p>Moreover, Alan has collaborated with Athlete Direct, which provides game-used or autographed basketball collectibles directly from the NCAA star and future pro.</p><p>Alan is most probably focused on his career; no reports of his dating life or girlfriend have ever made highlights.</p><p>The basketball player barely talks about his relationship. Therefore, sources proclaim that he is currently single.</p><h2>Net Worth Of Alan Griffin In Different Currencies</h2><p><span>Here is the net worth of Alan Griffin in different currencies, including the Euro and Dollar.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Currency</b></td><td><b>Net Worth</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Euro</b></td><td><span>€948,920</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Pound Sterling</b></td><td><span>£844,960</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Australian Dollar</b></td><td><span>A$1,515,841</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Canadian Dollar</b></td><td><span>C$1,375,730</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Indian Rupee</b></td><td><span>₹82,015,500</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>BitCoin</b></td><td><span>฿45.31</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQS)</span></h2><h3>Who is Alan's father?</h3><p>His father is Adrian Griffin, a former NBA basketball player and current assistant coach of the Raptors.</p><h3>Where is Alan currently affiliated with?</h3><p>Alan joined Newfoundland Growlers after being waived by the Westchester Knicks on January 23, 2022.</p><h3>Is Griffin a free agent?
