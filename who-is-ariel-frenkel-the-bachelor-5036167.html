In high school, Ariel took a summer creative writing course at New York University (2011), as well as a summer course in Creative Writing and Art History in Barcelona, Spain (2010).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-bachelor-5-things-update-embed1.jpg><h2>3. Ariel Is A World Traveler</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Ariel’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> page is full of photos from her travels around the world. “[Ariel] is a woman of the world and has traveled everywhere from Europe to Asia to South America and more,” Ariel’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ABC bio</a> reveals. Even when she’s at home, Ariel is looking for new adventure. “When she’s not jet-setting, she loves exploring her hometown of New York City and going on long walks,” her bio adds. Some of the locations she’s shared photos from include St. Barts, Spain, France, Portugal and many more.</p><h2>4. What Nationality Is Ariel?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Ariel is Ukranian. “She comes from a big, loving Ukranian family and is looking to find love like her parents have,” Ariel’s ABC bio says. The 28-year-old is also very passionate about her Jewish heritage, as her LinkedIn page reveals that she has volunteered at the United Jewish Appeal Federation of New York. During her hometown date with Zach, she introduced him to food at a Jewish deli in New York City. She also opened up to him about how her parents had to flee Russia because they weren’t welcome there due to being Jewish.</p><h2>5. Ariel Is A Foodie</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Not only does Ariel often post photos of food from her travels on Instagram, but she even studied cooking in Italy. In 2012, Ariel took a summer culinary course in Florence, Italy at the Apicius School of Culinary Arts, according to LinkedIn. She “learned how to prepare Italian cuisine by region, as well as the historical background of each region,” her page reveals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2Kus7XEpWSfqpWjuKa4jK2fnmWSlrCpscuoqWZtYGiDcoKWaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-kieran-rhodes-agt-season-17-4771778.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Kieran Rhodes?
