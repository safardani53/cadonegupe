Interestingly, the siblings’ trio is pretty much close to each other.</p><p>Bret has reached 53 years of age as of 2023. Similarly, his Zodiac sign is Capricorn. The Bielema family belongs to a White Caucasian ethnicity.</p><p>Likewise, the family owns an American Nationality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Family-Bret-Bielema-300x225.jpg><p>Now coming to his education, he completed his high school degree from Prophetstown High School.</p><p>Upon completing high school, the coach joined the University of Iowa. Bret graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Marketing.</p><p>During his college days, Brett was an outstanding football player. Therefore, one could easily presume that he would choose to pursue his career in the sport.</p><h2>Body Measurements&nbsp;</h2><p>Bret Bielema is a man with fair skin and short brown hair, and brown eyes. Not to mention, he is quite tall, standing at 6 feet 2 inches (1.8 m).</p><p>Although his weight hasn’t been updated or enclosed in the media, we can clearly see Bret has gained almost around 50 pounds.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bret Bielema | Career</h2><h3>Playing Career</h3><p>Brett started his sports career as a college football player. While at the University of Iowa, he played as a defensive lineman from 1989 to 1992.</p><p>Back then, Bielema served as a team captain in his senior season. He played under <strong>Coach Hayden Fry</strong>.</p><p>Bret’s team beat Iowa State by 21-7 in his senior season.</p><p>After this match, Bielema approached Iowa State head coach Jim Walden for a post-game handshake and said, “You’re a big prick. It’s been a pleasure kicking your ass the last five years.” (Iowa State had never won the match with Iowa while Bielema was with the team).</p><p>Bret’s statement created so much controversy that the University of Iowa officials sent an official apology letter to Jim.</p><p>After graduating from the University of Iowa, Bret also played for the Milwaukee Mustangs, a team in the Arena Football League.</p><h3>Coaching Career</h3><h4>Head Coach- University of Wisconsin (UW).</h4><h5>Coaching career (2006- 2007)</h5><p>Bret started his coaching career with Wisconsin Badgers, Madison, in 2006. In his first season game as a head coach, his team ended the regular season 11–1 (7–1 in Big Ten Conference play).</p><p>Likewise, on September 16, 2006, the team had a victory of 14–0 over San Diego State. Along with this win, Bielema became the third Wisconsin head coach to win the first three games of his career.</p><p>Interestingly Bielema kept adding a record of being the first head coach in Wisconsin to win seven games in the early season, winning 24–3 over Purdue on October 21.</p><p>Bret’s overwhelming wins did not just end there; he continued to become the first coach in Wisconsin history to win eight games in his first season.</p><p>Likewise, he broke his record with his ninth victory on November 4, over the Penn State Nittany Lions, by 13–3.</p><p>The record kept growing with his tenth victory over the Iowa Hawkeyes on November 11 by 24–21. Bret became the first head coach in Big Ten history to win ten games in his first season along with his win.</p><p>Importantly, his first coaching season continued to make him the first UW history coach to win 11 games in the regular season.</p><h5>Coaching career (2007-2012)</h5><p>Likewise, on January 1, 2007, his team won over the Arkansas Razorbacks in the Capital One Bowl by 17–14.</p><p>With his win, Brett became the third coach in NCAA history to win 12 games in his rookie season, finishing 12–1.</p><p>During his journey as head coach with Wisconsin, Bret kept a record of 17 wins in his first 18 games.</p><p>Along with this, he became the <strong>third-best among the best starter of a head coaching career in Big Ten history</strong>.</p><p>The first two were <a href=#>Urban Meyer</a>, who won 24 straight games, and Michigan’s Fielding H. Yost, who went 55–0–1 from 1901 to 1905.</p><p>After defeating #1-ranked Ohio State, by 31–18, Bielema wrote yet another piece of history for UW as the first win over a #1-ranked team since 1981.</p><p>Brett Bielema was nominated as a finalist for the <strong>2010 Bear Bryant Award</strong>. The award is given to the college football’s Coach of the Year.</p><p>However, he could not get the award as the award went to the other nominee, Gene Chizik of Auburn. Apparently, his career as a head coach of Wisconsin ended in the year 2012.</p><h4>Head Coach- University of Arkansas</h4><p>Brett announced to leave from Wisconsin and joined as the head coach of Arkansas on December 4,&nbsp;2012.</p><p>He left partly as he believed his assistant coaches were not paid well. And as well, he wanted to play in the <strong>Southeastern Conference (SEC)</strong>.</p><p>Sadly, Bielema’s first season with Arkansas Razorbacks did not go well. During this time, the Razorbacks recorded the worst SEC record since entering the conference in 1992.</p><p>However, the team showed a significant improvement in the second season. To achieve bowl eligibility, Razorbacks won two SEC games against LSU by 17–0 and Ole Miss by 30–0. However, they lost the remaining conference game.</p><p>Again, Bret’s third season with Arkansas did not go well. The team got a slow start and suffered losses. Moreover, the Razorbacks lost to Toledo and Texas Tech in the non-conference.</p><p>However, the season’s last games lead the team to victory over Kansas State by 45–23.</p><p>Additionally, Bielema’s fourth season went worse with two defeats to Missouri in the regular-season finale and Virginia Tech in the 2016 Belk Bowl.</p><p>After his not-so-good coaching experience with Razorbacks, Bielema was fired after his five seasons on November 24, 2017.</p><p>Bret Bielema was the highest-paid coach in Arkansas, with a salary of <strong>$4.2 million.</strong></p><h2>Bret Bielema | Buyout&nbsp;</h2><p>Amidst the firing process of Bielema, he had five seasons of success as a coach at Arkansas. Although his firing news blew up, he had a good turn of money around him as a buyout worth $11.9 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, with things set in his way, Bielema stood as a volunteer in the NFL team. Naturally, therefore, with the tables turned, Bielema only got around one-third portion of the buyout.&nbsp;</p><p>Actually, the Arkansas and Bielema contract stated that if Bielema had high-paying employment, Arkansas wouldn’t pay him.</p><p>In addition to that, Bret was simply a consultant to<a href=# rel=noopener> Bill Belichick</a>; however, Bret joined New England as the club’s defensive line coach.&nbsp;</p><p>Subsequently, Arkansas claimed that Bret breached their contract and stopped paying him. Altogether, this incident planted a fury in Bret, which was followed by a lawsuit against him.&nbsp;</p><h3>National Football League (NFL)</h3><p>So far, Bielema has worked for two NFL teams, the New England <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patriots</a> and the New York Giants.</p><p>Brett got a chance to work with NFL for the first time with the New England Patriots. Back then, he was hired as a defensive consultant to head coach <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bill Belichick</strong></a>.</p><p>Ahead of the 2019 season, Bret Bielema was promoted to defensive line coach.</p><p>Adding one next NFL team to his coaching career, Brett was hired next by the New York Giants. He joined the <strong>Giants</strong> on January 21, 2020, as the outside Linebackers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coach</a> and Senior Assistant.</p><p>After the Giants announced that he would join the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign as a head coach on December 19, 2020, back then, Illinois fired coach Lovie Smith.&nbsp;</p><p>In the first game with Illinois against the&nbsp;Nebraska Cornhuskers, he won the game. Also, it was said that Bret Bielema had signed 12&nbsp;recruiting&nbsp;classes as a head coach at Wisconsin and Arkansas.</p><p><strong>You can check your college stats of Bret <a href=#>here</a>.</strong></p><h2>Bret Bielema | Wife and Children</h2><p>After their four years of relationship, Bret engaged his girlfriend,<a href=#> <strong>Jennifer Hielsberg</strong></a>, on April 1,&nbsp;2011.</p><p>Likewise, the couple exchanged their marriage vows at a Catholic church in Madison’s private ceremony on March 10, 2012.</p><p>The couple seems to be enjoying their married life together. They entered their 8th wedding anniversary in March 2020.</p><p>Remembering the same, Bret took it to his Twitter handle to describe his beautiful memories with <a href=#>Jennifer</a> with their wedding photo and a caption that said,</p><p>“It doesn’t seem possible, but it was eight years ago today we took this walk together. Now we have added two beautiful girls and many memories.”</p><p>Bret’s wife, <a href=#>Jennifer</a>, worked as a model for different modeling agencies before marriage.
