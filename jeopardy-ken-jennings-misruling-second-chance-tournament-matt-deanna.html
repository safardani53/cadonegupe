Fetterman and his troop of 80 men."</p><p>The ruling was not reversed immediately as usual and was instead changed halfway through the <a href=#>typically light-hearted interview portion.</a></p><p>After Elliott revealed he met his current girlfriend when he first competed- she “slid into his DMs” as Ken joked - the host stopped the proceedings.</p><p>Ken shared at that point that he had not caught Deanna being incorrect.</p><h2>'BAD NEWS FIRST'</h2><p>“I’m afraid I have to give you the bad news first," Ken said when it was time to get to know her.</p><p>"I inadvertently accepted your response of Chief Joseph instead of Crazy Horse in the first round.”</p><p>“So we’re gonna have to knock that off your score.”</p><p>Deanna looked deflated, and her head slumped as her score was cut from $2400 to $400.</p><p>“But it’s early!” Ken continued. “You’ll be back.”</p><h2>'NEVER SEEN THAT'</h2><p>One person wrote on <a href=#>Reddit</a>: “Chief Joseph was not Oglalla!!! Good it was corrected, but I am shocked Ken did not know initially and accepted her answer."</p><p>Another wrote: “Apparently, they needed the response of 'crazy horse', not 'chief Joseph.'"</p><p>“After Googling, those are two entirely different people. Odd that Ken initially accepted it (and that the judges didn't immediately stop the taping). Did he think it was an AKA?"</p><p>A third argued: “Whoever wrote it wasn't on hand, which would explain why it took so long to be corrected."</p><p>A fourth wrote: "I've never seen them just straight up take a completely incorrect thing as correct before, I'm confused on how that even happens since surely Ken has the answer in his lectern?"</p><p>A fifth wrote: "Crazy Horse was not a chief. He was their war leader. It's like asking asking 'Along with Eisenhower, this president was instrumental in the Allied D-Day Invasion,' and the answer is Patton, but they accepted Truman. Horrible gaffe all around."</p><h2>MATT'S MISTAKE</h2><p>Deanna did come back; she had an impressive Double Jeopardy! round, but Matt found all of the Daily Doubles.</p><p>But with just eight clues left on the board and $5,000 to his name - Deanna leading with $17200 - Matt made a shocking choice.</p><p>Having missed the first two Daily Doubles, he decided just to bet $3000.</p><p>So despite being correct, Deanna still had a runaway or uncatchable lead going into Final Jeopardy.</p><p>She had $19,600, Elliott had $8,800, and Matt had $8,000.</p><p>Deanna's having a runaway proved even more pivotal since Matt was the only player correct in Final Jeopardy.</p><p>The clue read: “He dedicated books to each of his 4 wives, including Hadley Richardson & Martha Gellhorn.”</p><p>Only he was correct with “Hemingway” and wagered $7999- but since he didn’t have enough earnings going in, it didn’t matter.</p><p>One Redditor lamented: "Oof, Matt made a mistake not going all-in on the last Daily Double.</p><p>"Arguably cost him the whole game.</p><p>"Congrats to Deanna though. All three did very well."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/s-ken-jennings-forced-stop-846053726.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/s-ken-jennings-forced-stop-846053728.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-18-at-6.29.30-PM.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-18-at-6.31.47-PM.png><h2>ALL ABOUT THE SECOND CHANCE TOURNAMENT</h2><p>Each tournament week starts with three qualifying matches of Season 37 contestants instead of new players.</p><p>The three winners of the week face off in a Thursday/Friday final.</p><p>That winner advances to the next tournament;&nbsp;<a href=#>Champions Wildcard</a>.</p><p>That will air directly afterward and pit the winners from this series against brief Season 37 and 38 champions- the lineup is yet to be announced.</p><p>The subsequent eight-week tournament's price is a ticket to the currently postponed Tournament of Champions.</p><p>This takes fans into December, but given the writer's strikes, what will air after that is unannounced.</p><h2>EVERYTHING TO KNOW ABOUT SEASON 40</h2><p>Jeopardy!'s&nbsp;monumental&nbsp;<a href=#>Season 40</a>&nbsp;premiered on September 11 and will run until July 26, 2024.</p><p><a href=#>Ken</a> is hosting the entire season solo, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>&nbsp;is not involved as it stands.</p><p>She bowed out in solidarity with the strikers, a big shakeup since she and Ken were tapped to split hosting after&nbsp;<a href=#>Alex Trebek</a>'s&nbsp;death in 2020.</p><p>That's far from the only big change to the highly anticipated new season.</p><p>Aside from not having new contestants and no Mayim, the other major change is the clues.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>game show</a>&nbsp;is re-using questions from past seasons while without its writers.</p><p>Showrunner&nbsp;<a href=#>Michael Davies</a>&nbsp;explained on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Inside Jeopardy!” podcast</a>&nbsp;that it “wouldn’t be fair to have new contestants making their first appearance” on the show with material that isn’t original or that was written pre-strike.</p><p>"The material that we’re gonna be using is a combination of material that our WGA writers wrote before the strike, which is still in the database and material that is being redeployed from multiple, multiple seasons of the show.”</p><p>Davies also&nbsp;announced a $1000&nbsp;<a href=#>bump in consolation prizes</a> and said that he admires and misses the show’s beloved writers.</p><p>The news caused a scathing response from&nbsp;<a href=#>Masters winner&nbsp;James Holzhauer</a>, who took&nbsp;to the platform&nbsp;<a href=#>X</a>,&nbsp;formerly known as Twitter, to&nbsp;<a href=#>call out the show</a>.</p><p>“If you don’t have time to listen, here’s the executive summary of today’s announcement,” James, 39,&nbsp;wrote, sharing a link to the podcast episode.</p><p>“1:00-2:00: Jeopardy’s writers are invaluable and we couldn’t produce the show without them,” he continued.</p><p>“2:00-15:00: Here is how we will produce the upcoming season without them.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the 2023 Tournament of Champions will not happen not until the strikes are over.</p><p>Several Season 39 champs, including&nbsp;<a href=#>Ray LaLonde, Cris Pannullo, Hannah Wilson, and Ben Chan</a>, said they would not participate in the TOC until the strikes are concluded.</p><p>Ken has&nbsp;<a href=#>faced backlash from some fans and former players</a>&nbsp;for his decision to cross the picket line.</p><p>Ken has kept relatively quiet on the subject besides&nbsp;<a href=#>resharing a statement from the show’s executive producer</a>&nbsp;referencing how the late Alex continued hosting during the 2007 to 2008 writers’ strike.</p><p>Mayim&nbsp;is also being replaced by&nbsp;Ken&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Jeopardy!</a>,&nbsp;which airs on ABC for the entire next season.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><a href=#>Season 2 of Celebrity Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;is set to air on September 27 and its first&nbsp;<a href=#>slate of stars was announced last week.</a></p><p>Her exit marks&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken's first time hosting all programming</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;Jeopardy!
