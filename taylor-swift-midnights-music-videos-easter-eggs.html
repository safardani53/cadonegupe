Not only is the video filled with pointed references to her life in the spotlight, but she seems to tease her last three rerecorded albums — 1989, Reputation and Taylor Swift — and their release orders!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>references to her old eras</a> to hints about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>what's to come</a>, here's a breakdown of the Easter eggs from Swift's Midnights music videos.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-taylor-swifts-anti-hero-music-video-easter-eggs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Taylor Swift's "Anti-Hero" music video Easter eggs</span></h2><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lavender-glitter></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Lavender glitter</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Taylor Swift/YouTube</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the video, there are several instances of Swift encountering purple glitter, including the yolk in Swift's eggs and blood on her chest when she gets shot by an arrow. Not only could the purple glitter be a theme for the Midnights album as a whole, but it could be an Easter egg for an upcoming "Lavender Haze" music video, which was teased in her Midnights music video trailer.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ghosts-of-her-red-era></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ghosts of her Red era</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Taylor Swift/YouTube</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Swift sees ghosts in her home, two of them are sporting accessories from her Red era, a possible nod to her closing the door on Red (Taylor's Version) with the release of her new album. One ghost is shown wearing the iconic red heart sunglasses from her "22" music video, while the other wears a similar cat ears headband she donned later in the music video.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-old-taylor-coming-to-the-phone></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The old Taylor coming to the phone</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Taylor Swift/YouTube</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead of the release of Midnights, Swift teased all the songs from the album on TikTok with a series called "Midnights Mayhem with Me," in which she revealed the track titles by speaking into a red rotary phone similar to the one from her "Look What You Made Me Do" music video. Many fans theorized that the phone symbolized the "old Taylor" coming to the phone as the songs were about past experiences throughout her life. A similar rotary phone appears in the "Anti-Hero" music video as she tries to phone for help and realizes the wire has been cut.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-speak-now-guitar></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Speak Now guitar</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Taylor Swift/YouTube</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In one of the scenes in which Swift interacts with different versions of herself, the main Taylor is shown playing a guitar, while the more rambunctious Taylor is shown smashing the same guitar on the ground. Eagle-eyed fans noticed that the guitar is actually a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>limited edition Koi Living Jewels Acoustic Guitar</a> by Taylor Guitars, which Swift famously played each night during her Speak Now tour.

Fans think this could be a clue for her upcoming re-recording of 1989 as the singer has a track titled "Wonderland" on the album.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-archer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>"The Archer"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Taylor Swift/YouTube</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the tea party scene, there is also a shot of Swift getting struck in the heart by an arrow, which fans have interpreted as a reference to her track five song "The Archer" from Lover, in which she grapples with her anxiety and fears, similar to her "Anti-Hero" lyrics.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-photo-of-marjorie></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A photo of Marjorie</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Taylor Swift/YouTube</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Swift weighs herself in the bathroom, there is a framed photo of her grandmother Marjorie on the wall.

However, it's the music playing in the background that got fans' attention.

At one point, Dern tells Swift to "Speak not" as a nod to her album Speak Now.

There are 13 floors shown on the elevator, with different colors representing Swift's 10 albums and two recordings. After pressing the purple "3" button, representing Swift's third album Speak Now, Swift later gets off at floor 13, which is a dark purple, insinuating that Swift's next re-recording could be Speak Now (Taylor's Version).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-midnights-3am-edition></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Midnights (3am Edition)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Taylor Swift/YouTube</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In her performance scene, Swift is shown sitting on a clock that is set at 3.

Taylor Nation seemingly confirmed this theory when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>they retweeted a fan's tweet about it</a>.

The cover features two constellations, one for her astrological sign Sagittarius and another for Alwyn's astrological sign Pisces. The album cover is also a nod to the opening lyrics of "Mastermind" as Swift sings, "Once upon a time, the planets and the fates / And all the stars aligned / You and I ended up in the same room / At the same time."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-incense></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-121 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Incense</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-122 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Taylor Swift - Lavender Haze</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-123 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One shot shows incense burning beside Swift's bed, a nod to the lyrics of "Maroon."

Swift can also be seen standing on a slab that fans suggest features "1989" in Roman numerals, which could be her way of hinting at 1989 (Taylor's Version) as her next release after Speak Now (Taylor's Version).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-snake-queen></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-140 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Snake queen</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-141 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Taylor Swift/YouTube</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-142 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Swift tilts the scales in the first scene, the camera rotates clockwise to show Swift in what appears to be the Underworld. Fans believe this particular scene is hinting that Reputation (Taylor's Version) will be her next release after 1989 (Taylor's Version). Not only is her hair and makeup reminiscent of her Reputation album cover, but she is also wearing a Medusa Chain Necklace by Versace, alluding to all the snake imagery from that specific era.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-wizard-of-oz></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-144 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Wizard of Oz</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-145 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Taylor Swift/YouTube</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-146 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the Underworld scene, the camera tilts clockwise yet again to show Swift skipping down a yellow brick road reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz. Seeing that The Wizard of Oz was Judy Garland's film debut, fans believe this is signaling that Taylor Swift (Taylor's Version) will be her next release following 1989 (Taylor's Version) and Reputation (Taylor's Version).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-148 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Others think the scene could be a hint that Swift will be featured on the Barbie movie soundtrack, which has <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>its own share of Wizard of Oz Easter eggs</a> throughout. A handful of Swift's friends, including Haim and Gayle, have been confirmed for the soundtrack, with more to be announced at a later date.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-purple-hourglass></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-150 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Purple hourglass</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-151 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Taylor Swift/YouTube</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-152 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the Wizard of Oz scene, the camera actually moves counterclockwise to show Swift on each side of an hourglass.

Some think her black and blue nail polish could represent Reputation (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), respectively, and their places on the clock could signal the month of their releases. Others believe that Swift could be teasing a double album drop on Aug. 2 as her fingers are positioned on 8 and 2 on the clock.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-midnight-era-ending></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-166 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Midnight era ending</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-167 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Taylor Swift/YouTube</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-168 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The end of the video shows the hands on the clock snapping to midnight, seemingly symbolizing that the Midnights era has come to a close as she prepares to release <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Speak Now (Taylor's Version)</a> on July 7.
