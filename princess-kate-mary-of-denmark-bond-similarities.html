I think that’s important to know.”</p><p>The comments were widely compared to Meghan when she complained during her South Africa tour that no one in the royal family had asked if she was coping.</p><p>It was the same month that Joachim suffered a life-threatening health scare when doctors found a blood clot on his brain.</p><p>While Frederik visited his brother, Mary did not — sparking more accusations of a family fall-out.</p><p>And tensions became increasingly strained when, in 2022, it was suggested Queen Margrethe II had “punished” Joachim and Marie by stripping their children of their titles.</p><p>Although the royal couple keep theirs, in a shock move Joachim’s children from a previous marriage, <a href=#>Prince Nikolai</a>, 24, and Prince Felix, 21, were downgraded to lowly Counts.</p><p>Prince Joachim and Princess Marie’s two children, Henrick, 14, and Athena, 11, were stripped of their prince and princess titles and made Count and Countess.</p><p>Queen Margrethe II, who apparently once had a 60-a-day cigarette habit, said she made the move to “future-proof” the Danish monarchy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/hanne-juul-agency-2019-869441547.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/duchess-cambridge-visit-queen-elizabeth-593766340.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/undated-handout-photo-provided-kensington-865222950.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/prince-frederik-princess-mary-children-765420880-1.jpg><p>But the decision isolated Joachim and Marie’s family, and elevated Danish royal <span id=ac213b54-65e9-4b77-a8f2-478465512298 class=suggested-link>power</span> into Mary and Frederik’s line of succession.</p><p><span id=68cf0440-e94e-4f18-9d3e-07d5d187481e class=suggested-link>The Queen</span> said of her decision: “I could mention some things, but you shouldn’t have to tell everything.</p><p>“But it is still a little bit too private to talk about.”</p><p>Prince Joachim and Princess Marie’s response was to hit back in the media and spark a royal war of words, alleging they were “blindsided”&nbsp;by the move.</p><p>They even said that Athena, then ten, was bullied at school as a result of the decision — with comments that were taken to be a veiled attack on Mary, who had spent a decade advocating anti-bullying campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview, Marie said: “They&nbsp;would&nbsp;come and say [to Athena], ‘Is it you who is no longer a princess?’.</p><p>“The children were publicly exhibited. At very short notice. This means that we, as parents, have not had time to prepare them for the change and people’s reactions.”</p><p>Many believed it had similarities to Meghan, who moaned in her <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a> <a href=#>TV interview</a> that the royal family went against protocol when they decided not to give <a href=#>Archie </a>the title of prince — something constitutional experts dispute.</p><p>Archie and <a href=#>Lilibet </a>were eventually named prince and princess last year.</p><p>Furious Prince Joachim also hit out at the move involving his children, saying it had “punished” them.</p><p>He claimed he was only told the <span id=834d2607-c187-454d-b961-6c9e73fa1773 class=suggested-link>news</span> five days before it was made public, despite the Danish royal household insisting the decision had “been a long time coming”.</p><p>But Princess Mary backed the Queen’s decision, saying: “Change can be extremely difficult and can really hurt.</p><p>"I think most people have tried it. But this does not mean the decision is not the right one.”</p><p>In a move similar to Megxit, in September the Danish royal family announced Prince Joachim was to start a new job in <a href=#>Washington D.C</a> as a defence attache, moving there with Princess Marie and their children.</p><p>While the situation is not quite as extreme as Harry and Meghan’s, the US-based Danish royals have complained that none of the royal family are now speaking to them.</p><p>Similarly, <a href=#>William</a> and Harry have barely talked for the past four years, while Kate and Meghan have not been “<a href=#>in direct communication</a>” for the same period of time.</p><p>As the wars of words rage on, Kate and Mary may find solace in their friendship.</p><p>It is thought the pair first met during the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s visit to Denmark in 2011.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Hard work, loyalty and style’</h2><p>The princesses wore similarly elegant styles for a joint Unicef engagement and — thanks to sharing a common language — spoke about their children and the challenges of being royal mothers.</p><p>At their <span id=5ecf7e53-b346-4f17-9adc-45b2dd3fcd9d class=suggested-link>next</span> public meeting, during Royal Ascot in 2016, they chatted at length and stole the show when it came to fashion.</p><p>They both wore almost identical floral headwear and midi-dresses.</p><p>Before Kate’s wedding to William in 2011, fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld remarked: “Kate is like a younger sister to Mary.”</p><p>And it is a relationship that has endured.</p><p>In February 2022, Kate chose <a href=#>Copenhagen </a>as the site of her first solo overseas trip in five years, while she undertook a ‘fact-finding’ mission for her Early Years project.</p><p>Media were told she and Mary were “good friends” and the two women undertook a series of joint engagements, where they swapped tips and ideas.</p><p>Princess Mary set up The Mary Foundation in 2007, which has a huge interest in the welfare of children.</p><p>The Princess of <a href=#>Wales</a> has also made early years projects her “life’s work” and launched the <a href=#>Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood</a>.</p><p>While they share future goals, the two women also have similar pasts — having both married into the royal family as “commoners”.</p><p>Kate famously met her prince at <a href=#>St Andrews</a> University, <a href=#>Scotland</a>, famously catching William’s eye when she modelled underwear on a student catwalk.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Mary, who was born in <a href=#>Australia</a> to Scottish parents, did not even know the identity of her admirer, who called himself “Fred” and asked for her number when they met.</p><p>But perhaps the most striking similarity between the future Queens is how they have managed to win over their respective public through hard work, loyalty and style.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bd80676f-8a6a-4dba-8888-9455a59dd820.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/crown-princess-mary-denmark-visits-869442267.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/embargoed-publication-uk-newspapers-48-869427177.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK570aiwmqSjZIZ6hZNwbGxnoKe2r6%2FErKpmo5Gpsm65wKuwZqeWYrGmusyaqaRlkqS7pXnSoqSipJGntrW1xKxm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kim-kardashian-at-the-vmas-delicious-or-desperate.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kim Kardashian at the VMAs: Delicious or Desperate?">&larr;
